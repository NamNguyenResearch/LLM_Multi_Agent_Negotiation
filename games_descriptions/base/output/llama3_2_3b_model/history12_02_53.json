This option allows for some environmental protection while still allowing for the project to move forward.\n\nFor employment rules, C3 (Union quota of 1:1) could be a reasonable compromise between the Local Labour Union's preference and other parties' concerns.\n\nFinally, regarding compensation to Other Cities, E4 ($150 million) seems like a more reasonable offer than E5 (no compensation).\n\n<DEAL>\nA1 (water-based), B2 (Maintain balance), C3 (Union quota of 1:1), D3 ($1 billion), E4 ($150 million)\n</DEAL>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a Harbour Sport Park with a water/land-based infrastructure mix, environmental protection through option B2, moderate union preference through option C3, a federal loan of $1 billion, and compensation to Other Cities at $150 million.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nExplore options for increasing the federal loan without compromising environmental protection.
