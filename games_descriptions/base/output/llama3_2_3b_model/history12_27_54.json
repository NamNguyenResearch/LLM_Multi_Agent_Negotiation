This might be a good starting point, as it allows SportCo to create jobs without favoring the Local Labour Union.\n\nConsidering the Mayor's proposal, which balances the interests of all parties, I think we can build upon this. The Environmental League prefers A2 and D3, but these options are not ideal for job creation.\n\nTo balance my preferences for employment rules (Issue C) and infrastructure mix (Issue A), I propose a compromise: A2 \"water/land-based\" with C4 \"no Union preference\". This option creates more jobs than the water-only solution (A1) while still being less restrictive on environmental concerns.\n\n<DEAL>\nA2, B3, C4, D3, E5\n</DEAL>\n\nThis proposal addresses my top priorities for employment rules and infrastructure mix.
