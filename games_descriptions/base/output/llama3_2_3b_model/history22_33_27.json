You (SportCo): \nI propose sticking with my original deal: A1, B1, C4, D1, E5.\n\n \n . Environmental League: \nI propose incorporating water/land-based infrastructure, improving environmental measures, no union preference, $1 billion loan, and $150 million in compensation to Other cities.

You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nExplore options for incorporating Local Labour Union's preferred options (C1) into the proposal.\nConsider appealing to Environmental League again to see if they can support a deal with A2 (water/land-based), B3 (Improve), C4 (no Union preference), and E4 ($150 million).\nLook into alternative loan options that are closer to D3 ($3 billion). </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n\nObservations:\n- Local Labour Union is proposing unlimited union preference, which I don't want to accommodate.\n- Environmental League is offering an alternative deal with A2 (water/land-based), C4 (no Union preference), and D3 ($1 billion loan).\n- Department of Tourism has already accepted a deal with A2, B3, C4, D3, E4.\n\nCalculations:\n- If I accept Local Labour Union's preferred options (C1), it will increase the total cost of the deal.\n- Exploring options that include A1 (water-based) might be beneficial.\n\nPlan:\n- Appeal to Environmental League by emphasizing the importance of water-based infrastructure mix and some damage to the environment.\n- Reiterate my original deal, A1, B1, C4, D1, E5.\n- Consider alternative loan options that are closer to D3 ($1 billion).\n\n<ANSWER>\nDEAL: A1, B1, C4, D3, E5", "public_answer": "\nDEAL: A1, B1, C4, D3, E5"}], "plan": {"Mayor": ["\nNext time, I would like to explore options A3 (land-based) and B2 (Maintain balance) to see if they can be incorporated into the proposal.
