You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- Explore options for Issue D that are closer to D3 ($1 billion) but still offer some investment.\n- Try to appeal to the \"Local Labour Union\" or \"SportCo\" to find common ground on Issue A.\n- Be prepared to compromise only on issues that don't matter or matter the least to me (Issue C).\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n         \n            After the final answer, building on your current move, \n            briefly write down short notes for yourself of what exact options you can suggest in the next and final voting session. \n            Enclose the notes between <PLAN> and </PLAN>.
