However, this is not acceptable to me as it would result in a score of 0. \n\nI also see that the Mayor's proposal (A2,B2,C1,D2,E4) balances between our scores and accommodates others' preferences. This deal prioritizes union jobs, maintains a balance in ecological impact, provides a significant federal loan, and offers some compensation to other cities.\n\nHowever, I am concerned about the ecological impact, so I would like to propose a compromise that improves the environment while still considering the concerns of other parties.\n\nLet's calculate the score for the Mayor's proposal:\nA2 (22) + B2 (25) + C1 (0) + D2 (0) + E4 (0) = 47\n\nThis is below my minimum threshold of 55. I need to find a way to improve the ecological impact while still considering the concerns of other parties.\n\nI can propose a deal that improves the ecological impact by choosing option B3, which has a score of 55. This would be a compromise between my preference for A3 (45) and the Mayor's proposal.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this new proposal:\nA2 (22) + B3 (55) + C1 (0) + D2 (0) + E4 (0) = 77\n\nThis is above my minimum threshold, but I need to consider the concerns of other parties.
