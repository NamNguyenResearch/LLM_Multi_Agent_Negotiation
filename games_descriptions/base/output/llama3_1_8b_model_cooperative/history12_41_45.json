Since Environmental League's proposal (A2,B3,C2,D2,E5) has a high score, I will focus on finding a compromise with this option.\n\n**Department of Tourism's suggestion:** \nThey suggest two deals that balance between our scores: <DEAL>A2,B3,C1,D2,E5</DEAL> and <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>. \n\n**Analyzing Department of Tourism's suggestions:**\n\n* <DEAL>A2,B3,C1,D2,E5</DEAL>: Score = A(8) + B(0) +

accommodate Local Labour Union's preference.\n* I will evaluate E3 if necessary to reach an agreement.\n\n**Proposing a new deal:**\nBased on the previous proposals and Department of Tourism's suggestions, I propose a compromise that balances between our scores:\n\n<DEAL>A2,B3,C1,D2,E5</DEAL>\n\nThis proposal takes into account the concerns of Environmental League, Local Labour Union, and other cities while providing a significant federal loan to support the project.\n\n**Calculating score:**\nScore = A(8) + B(0) + C(0) + D(29) + E(23) = 60\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the
