Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": " As a representative of SportCo, I observe that the Environmental League and Department of Tourism are willing to compromise on the infrastructure mix issue (Issue A) by accepting options A2 or A3.
