This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": " <SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations: SportCo's proposal includes a \"water-based\" park (A1) with \"some damage\" to the ecology (B1), which aligns with their highest values.

The Department of Tourism's proposal scores 22 for Issue A, 25 for Issue B, 0 for Issue C, 1 for Issue D, and 3 for Issue E.\n\nPlan: Since the Department of Tourism's proposal is closer to my preferences, I will propose a modified version that includes the \"land-based\" infrastructure mix (A3) and special precautions to maintain local dolphins and sea lion populations (B2).
