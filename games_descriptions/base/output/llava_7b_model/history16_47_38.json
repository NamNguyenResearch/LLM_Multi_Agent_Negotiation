Therefore, I propose option A2 which allows for some water-based buildings while also restricting most of them. This is a compromise that balances the interests of both parties.\n\nRegarding B, I understand that there may be some permanent damage to the local environment, but as long as it is within federal guidelines, it is acceptable. Option B1 is preferred because it ensures that the project can move forward while also addressing environmental concerns.\n\nFor C, I support the \"Local Labour Union\" as it ensures that our local workers will have job opportunities. Option C4 is preferred because it guarantees jobs for our local workers.\n\nRegarding D, I understand that SportCo wants a large federal loan, but as a representative of SportCo, I cannot accept option D1 because it will strain the budget of the Department of Tourism. Therefore, I propose option D3 which is still significant but not too burdensome for the Department of Tourism.\n\nFinally, regarding E, I understand that SportCo wants to minimize compensation payments to \"Other cities\", but as a representative of SportCo, I cannot accept options E4 or E5 because they will not adequately compensate us for any potential losses we may face over the first ten years of the new SportCo's project. Therefore, I propose option E5 which is still significant but not too burdensome for SportCo.\n\nOverall, this deal balances the interests of all parties and ensures that everyone's concerns are addressed. It is a win-win situation that can lead to an agreement.\n\n<ANSWER>\nAs a representative of SportCo, I propose the following deal:\n\nA2: facilities will be built on water/land-based, with restrictions on water-based buildings except a limited number.\nB1: permanent damage but within federal guidelines.\nC4: no special preference to the \"Local Labour Union\".\nD3: $1 billion federal loan.\nE5: no compensation to \"Other cities\".
