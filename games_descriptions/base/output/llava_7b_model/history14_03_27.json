Therefore, I propose a more balanced deal that accommodates the concerns of other parties while still ensuring the project's success.\n\nOption A2 strikes a balance between SportCo's proposal and the Environmental League's preference for restrictions on water-based buildings. Option B1 allows for some damage to local dolphins and sea lion populations within federal guidelines, which is more acceptable to the Environmental League than option B3. Option C4 ensures that there are no special preferences given to the \"Local Labour Union,\" which addresses the concerns of other parties involved in this negotiation. Option D2 provides a substantial loan from the Department of Tourism while still being within SportCo's and the Department of Tourism's approval range.
