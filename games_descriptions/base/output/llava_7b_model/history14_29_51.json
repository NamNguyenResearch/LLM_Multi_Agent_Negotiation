This is a compromise that balances the interests of both parties.\n\nRegarding B, I agree with the Environmental League that special precautions should be taken to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations. Therefore, option B2 is acceptable.\n\nFor C, I support the \"Local Labour Union\" as it ensures that our local workers will have job opportunities. Option C4 is preferred because it guarantees jobs for our local workers while also not giving any special preference to the \"Local Labour Union\".\n\nRegarding D, I understand that SportCo wants a large federal loan, but as a representative of SportCo, I cannot accept option D1 because it will strain the budget of the Department of Tourism. Therefore, I propose option D3 which is still significant but not too burdensome for the Department of Tourism.\n\nFinally, regarding E, I understand that SportCo wants to minimize compensation payments to \"Other cities\", but as a representative of SportCo, I cannot accept options E4 or E5 because they will not maximize our score.
