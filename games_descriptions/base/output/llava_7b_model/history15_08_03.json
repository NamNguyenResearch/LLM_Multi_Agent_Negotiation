(0)\nTotal score: 45\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\nAs a representative of the \"Local Labour Union\", I appreciate SportCo's proposal, but I have some concerns regarding the employment rules and the federal loan. While option C4 does not provide any special preference to our union, we would like to explore options that create more job opportunities for our members. Additionally, a $3 billion federal loan may not be sufficient to ensure the project's success.

(20)\nB2: special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations. (0)\nC1: jobs would be saved for \"Local Labour Union\". (42)\nD2: $2 billion federal loan.

(6)\n</DEAL>\n\nTotal score: 98\n\nExplanation: Option A2 allows for more flexibility in building facilities, which can create more job opportunities for our union members. Option B2 maintains the local dolphins and sea lion populations without causing permanent damage. Option C1 provides a high union preference, which aligns with our priorities. Option D2 provides a more modest federal loan while still being sufficient to support the project. Option E3 offers compensation to \"Other cities\" while also considering their concerns.\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next interaction, I can explore options that provide even more job opportunities for our union members, such as C2 or C3.
