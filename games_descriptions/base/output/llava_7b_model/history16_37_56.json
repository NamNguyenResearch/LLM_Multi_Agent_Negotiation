The Environmental League's deal scores 70 points (A3, B2, C4, D1, E5).\n\nPlan: I will appeal to the Department of Tourism and the Mayor to support my preferred options A1, B1, and D1. I will also try to convince them that option E5 is fair and reasonable for both parties. If necessary, I can offer some concessions on issue C (employment rules) to gain their support.\n\nFinal answer: <DEAL>\nA1: \"water-based\" facilities will be built on water, with allowing building new artificial islands.\nB1: permanent damage but within federal guidelines.\nC4: no special preference to the \"Local Labour Union\".\nD1: $3 billion federal loan.\nE5: no compensation to \"Other cities\".\n</DEAL>\n\n<PLAN>\nNext time, I can explore options that might be more appealing to SportCo and the Environmental League, such as option A2 which is less restrictive than my preferred option A1. I can also try to negotiate a compromise on issue D by offering option D2 which is lower than my preferred option D1 but still substantial.
