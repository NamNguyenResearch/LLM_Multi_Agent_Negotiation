Department of Tourism: \nI propose maintaining my initial deal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL> with minor concessions on C4 or E5, and offer SportCo a compromise: switch from A1 to A2 in exchange for switching from B1 to B3.\nI also ask the Environmental League to support this proposal in exchange for supporting my deal. \n . Other cities: \nI propose the deal <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL> as a balanced agreement that meets my minimum score threshold and is more likely to lead to an agreement.\nThis deal balances between our scores and accommodating others, considering all parties' interests.\nIt also shows flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n* Try to persuade the Mayor, Local Labour Union, Department of Tourism, and Environmental League to support my initial deal\n* Offer minor concessions on C4 or E5 in exchange for their support\n* Consider making a counter-proposal that combines elements from both previous proposals, such as <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E3</DEAL> or <DEAL>A1,B2,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>. </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* Mayor, Local Labour Union, Department of Tourism, and Environmental League all proposed similar deals (<DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>, <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL>, <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D2,E5</DEAL>) that balance between their scores and accommodating others.\n* Other cities proposed a deal (<DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>) that is more likely to lead to an agreement.\n\n**Deal Calculations:**\n\n* My initial deal: <DEAL>A1,B1,C4,D1,E5</DEAL>\n* Mayor's proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n* Local Labour Union's proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C2,D2,E4</DEAL>\n* Department of Tourism's proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL>\n* Environmental League's proposal: <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D2,E5</DEAL>\n\n**Plan:**\n\nSince all parties are proposing similar deals, I'll try to maximize my score by making a counter-proposal that combines elements from both previous proposals.\n\nI will propose a deal that switches A1 to A2 and B1 to B3, while keeping C4, D1, and E5.
