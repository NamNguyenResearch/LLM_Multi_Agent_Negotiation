It also accepts unlimited union preference for SportCo, while providing fair compensation of $350 million to other cities.\n \n . Environmental League: <SCRATCHPAD>\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* All parties have proposed similar deals with A2, B1 or B2, C2, D2, and E3 or E4.\n* SportCo has stuck to their initial proposal of unlimited union preference (C1) in some deals.\n* Other cities prefer higher compensation, but may accept E3.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* My minimum acceptable score is 55. I need to find a way to increase the score for issues A and B while keeping the other issues as they are.\n* Issue E (compensation) is not a priority for me, but I can explore options E1 or E3 to increase compensation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n* Try to convince SportCo to compromise on issue C by suggesting C2 or C4.\n* Use my influence to nudge other parties towards accepting A3 (land-based infrastructure mix) as an alternative to A2.\n* Keep in mind that I need to maintain a balance between environmental protection and other parties' interests.\n\n**Considering Others' Preferences:**\n\n* Department of Tourism prefers D2, but may compromise on D3 or D4.\n* Other cities prefer higher compensation, but may accept E3.\n\n**Exploring Options:**\n\n* Issue B: I can try to negotiate with SportCo to move from B1 to B3 (Improve).\n* Issue A: I can suggest A3 (land-based infrastructure mix) as an alternative to A2.\n\n**New Proposal:**\n\nI propose <DEAL>A3,B3,C4,D2,E3</DEAL> as a revised deal. This deal maintains a land-based infrastructure mix and prioritizes improving the local dolphin and sea lion populations, while reducing the federal loan amount to $2 billion and providing fair compensation of $350 million to other cities.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* I'm willing to compromise on issue C by accepting no union preference (C4) in exchange for SportCo's support.\n* I'm also willing to accept a land-based infrastructure mix (A3) as an alternative to A2, which is more environmentally friendly.\n* By prioritizing improving the local dolphin and sea lion populations (B3), I'm ensuring that environmental protection is maintained.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score of 55 and balances the interests of all parties. It also takes into account other parties' preferences and priorities, while maximizing my score as much as possible. </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n* Offer A3 (land-based) in exchange for accepting C1 (unlimited union preference).\n* Propose A1 (more water/land-based) and see if Environmental League accepts it.\n* Stick to D1 ($3 billion), as it's the highest amount that maintains my score. </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\n\n**Observations:**\n\n* All parties have proposed similar deals with A2, B1 or B2, C2, D2, and E3 or E4.\n* SportCo has stuck to their initial proposal of unlimited union preference (C1) in some deals.\n* Other cities prefer higher compensation, but may accept E3.\n\n**Calculations:**\n\n* My minimum acceptable score is 55.
