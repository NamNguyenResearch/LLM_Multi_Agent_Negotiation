Deals**\n\n* They propose two deals that balance between their scores and accommodating others:\n\t+ Deal 1: A2,B3,C2,D2,E4 (Score: 20+0+35+20+8 = 83)\n\t+ Deal 2: A3,B3,C2,D1,E4 (Score: 0+0+35+10+8 =

others:\n\n<DEAL>A2,B3,C3,D2,E4</DEAL>\n\nThis deal offers:\n* A water/land-based infrastructure mix (A2), which creates more jobs than option A1.\n* Special precautions to maintain the local dolphins and sea lion populations (B3).\n* A union quota of 1:1 (C3), which is a compromise on my top priority but still favorable.\n* A federal loan of $2 billion (D2), which is lower than option D1 but still acceptable.\n* Compensation of $300 million to other cities (E4), which is a balance between their concerns and my minimum score threshold.\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score threshold and considers the preferences of other parties, such as the Environmental League's concern for environmental improvement and Other Cities' request for compensation.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the deal
