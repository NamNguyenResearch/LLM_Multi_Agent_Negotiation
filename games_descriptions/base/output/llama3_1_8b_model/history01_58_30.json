I suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL> as a final proposal.\n\nHowever, considering that SportCo has been pushing for A1 and D1, I will make one last attempt to compromise. I suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C1,D1,E4</DEAL> as an alternative proposal.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* I need to be careful not to completely ruin the deal by making too many concessions.\n* I should try to convince Environmental League and Mayor to support my proposal (A2,B3,C4,D1,E5).\n\nHowever, considering that both Environmental League and Mayor have already proposed A2,B3,C4,D1,E5 as a final agreement, I will adjust my plan as follows:\n\n**New Plan:**\n\n* I will try to appeal to Environmental League and Mayor's proposal (A2,B3,C4,D1,E5) and see if they are willing to make any concessions.\n* However, since we are in the final discussion session and time is running out, I will focus on making a deal that maximizes my score rather than trying to accommodate others' preferences.\n\n**Final Move:**\n\nI will propose a deal that combines some of the best options from previous proposals. I suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL> as a final proposal.\n\nThis deal offers a water/land-based infrastructure mix, maintains balance with the environment, allows no union preference, provides a $3 billion federal loan, and offers no compensation to other cities.\n\nHowever, considering that SportCo has been pushing for A1 and D1, I will make one last attempt to compromise. I suggest <DEAL>A2,B3,C1,D1,E4</DEAL> as an alternative proposal.\n\nThis deal offers a water/land-based infrastructure mix, maintains balance with the environment, allows unlimited union preference, provides a $3 billion federal loan, and compensates other cities ($300 million).\n\nI hope this final proposal will be acceptable to all parties and maximize my score. \n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose <DEAL>A2,B3,C4,D1,E5</DEAL> as a final agreement that maximizes my score.
