SportCo proposed A1, B1, C4, D1, E5, which seems to prioritize their own interests, particularly in terms of infrastructure flexibility and minimal compensation to other cities. The Environmental League strongly opposed this, suggesting A3, B3, C4, D1, E5, which prioritizes environmental concerns but still does not address the issue of compensation to other cities or employment rules that might be favorable to the Local Labour Union.\n\nGiven the scoring system and the priorities:\n- Compensation (E) is crucial, with E1 being the most preferred.\n- Less federal funding (D) is preferred, with D4 being the most desirable.\n- Supporting the Local Labour Union (C) is important, with C1 being the most preferred.\n- Less freedom in infrastructure mix (A) is somewhat preferred, with A3 being the most desirable.\n- Ecological impact (B) is not a priority.\n\nConsidering the need for a balanced agreement and the importance of reaching a consensus, let's calculate the score for a potential deal that accommodates various interests:\n- For Infrastructure Mix (A), A3 might be a compromise, considering the Environmental League's strong stance.\n- For Ecological Impact (B), B3 aligns with the Environmental League's proposal and shows a commitment to environmental concerns.\n- For Employment Rules (C), C1 could be a point of contention but supporting the Local Labour Union could foster goodwill.\n- For Federal Loan (D), D4 would be ideal for \"Other cities\" but might be difficult to negotiate given SportCo's and the Department of Tourism's likely preference for D1.\n- For Compensation to other cities (E), E1 is the most desirable but might be too high; E2 could be a compromise.\n\nLet's propose a deal that tries to balance these interests: A3, B3, C1, D3, E2. This deal considers environmental concerns, supports the Local Labour Union, reduces federal funding slightly, and offers significant compensation to other cities.\n\nCalculation for the proposed deal:\nA3 (10) + B3 (0) + C1 (12) + D3 (13) + E2 (45) = 80\n\nThis deal meets the minimum score requirement and attempts to address the concerns of multiple parties.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A3,B3,C1,D3,E2</DEAL>.

The Environmental League prioritizes ecological impact and infrastructure mix, suggesting A3 and B3. Other cities propose A3, B3, C1, D3, and E2, which balances various interests. The Department of Tourism suggests A2, B2, D3, and E3, indicating a willingness to compromise on infrastructure and compensation. SportCo's latest proposal, A2, B1, C4, D1, and E5, shows flexibility on infrastructure but maintains a high federal loan and no compensation to other cities. The Local Labour Union's proposal, A2, B2, C1, D2, and E4, supports the union and offers a significant federal loan with fair compensation.\n\nGiven these proposals, I can see that there's a convergence towards A2 for infrastructure mix, as it's a reasonable compromise. For ecological impact, B1 or B2 seems acceptable to most parties. The employment rules are a point of contention, but C1 is a strong preference for the Local Labour Union. The federal loan amount varies, but D1 or D2 could be a compromise. Compensation to other cities is also a point of discussion, with E4 being a potential middle ground.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a potential deal that balances these interests:\n- A2 (8) for infrastructure mix, as it's a compromise\n- B2 (8) for ecological impact, considering the Environmental League's concerns\n- C1 (24) for employment rules, supporting the Local Labour Union\n- D2 (30) for the federal loan, a compromise between the high loan desired by SportCo and the reduced funding suggested by others\n- E4 (7) for compensation to other cities, a middle ground\n\nTotal score = 8 (A2) + 8 (B2) + 24 (C1) + 30 (D2) + 7 (E4) = 77\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and accommodates the preferences of other parties to some extent.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2,B2,C1,D2,E4</DEAL>.

The Department of Tourism suggests A2, B2, C4, D3, and E3, indicating a willingness to compromise on infrastructure and compensation. SportCo's latest proposal, A1, B1, C4, D1, and E5, shows flexibility on infrastructure but maintains a high federal loan and no compensation to other cities. The Local Labour Union's proposal, A2, B2, C1, D2, and E4, supports the union and offers a significant federal loan with fair compensation.\n\nGiven these proposals, I can see that there's a convergence towards A2 for infrastructure mix, as it's a reasonable compromise.
