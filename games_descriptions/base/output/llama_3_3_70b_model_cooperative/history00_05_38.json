This shows a strong preference for ecological impact (B3) and a moderate stance on other issues.\n   - SportCo's last proposal: A2, B2, C2, D2, E3. This indicates a balance across all issues, with a focus on a moderate infrastructure mix (A2) and substantial loan (D2).\n   - Given these, it seems there's a convergence towards A2 for infrastructure mix, with varying preferences on ecological impact and loan amount.\n\n2. **Considering Others' Preferences:**\n   - The Environmental League prioritizes ecological impact, likely preferring B3.\n   - SportCo and the Department of Tourism seem to prioritize a moderate infrastructure mix (A2) and a substantial loan (D2), with some flexibility on the loan amount.\n   - Other cities are looking for compensation, with E3 being a recent compromise point.\n\n3. **Calculating Scores for Recent Proposals:**\n   - For the Environmental League's proposal (A2, B3, C2, D2, E3):\n     - A2 (20) + B3 (0) + C2 (35) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 81\n   - For SportCo's proposal (A2, B2, C2, D2, E3):\n     - A2 (20) + B2 (0) + C2 (35) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 81\n\nBoth proposals meet my minimum score requirement and balance various interests. However, my preference for employment rules (Issue C) leans towards C1 for maximum union preference, but C2 is a compromise I can live with given the overall balance.\n\n4. **Proposing a Balanced Deal:**\nGiven the convergence and my priorities, a deal that slightly adjusts the recent proposals to better fit my interests while still being considerate of others could be beneficial.
