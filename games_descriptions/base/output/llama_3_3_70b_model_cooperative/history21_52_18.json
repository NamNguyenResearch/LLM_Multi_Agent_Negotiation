The \"Environmental League\" prioritizes ecological impact, suggesting options like B3. \"Other cities\" are concerned with compensation, leaning towards higher payments like E1 or E2. The \"Department of Tourism\" and \"SportCo\" seem to focus on a balance between infrastructure development, federal loan, and employment rules.\n\nGiven the history, a common ground seems to be A2 for infrastructure mix, as it's been proposed by multiple parties including the \"Department of Tourism\", \"Environmental League\", and \"Other cities\". For ecological impact, B2 appears to be a middle ground that could satisfy the \"Environmental League\" while being acceptable to others. Employment rules are crucial for me, and C2 seems like a compromise that could work, considering it's been suggested by several parties. The federal loan is important for the project's success, and D2 is a moderate option that could appeal to both \"SportCo\" and the \"Department of Tourism\". Lastly, for compensation to other cities, E3 or E4 could be a compromise, but since E4 has been suggested by \"SportCo\" and the \"Mayor\", it might have a better chance of being accepted.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a potential deal that accommodates these observations:\n- A2 (20)\n- B2 (0)\n- C2 (35)\n- D2 (20)\n- E4 (8)\n\nTotal score = 20 + 0 + 35 + 20 + 8 = 83\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to balance the interests of various parties involved.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the needs of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>.
