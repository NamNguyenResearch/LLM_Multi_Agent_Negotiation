A2, B2, C1, D1, E3: This could appeal to multiple parties, including myself, by offering a high union preference, a balanced ecological impact, a significant federal loan, and some compensation to other cities.\nFrom my perspective, this deal would score: \nA2 (20) + B2 (0) + C1 (42) + D1 (30) + E3 (6) = 98.\n\nGiven this analysis, I will suggest a deal that balances the interests of all parties involved.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that considers the needs of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C1, D1, E3</DEAL>.

However, it's clear that SportCo values flexibility in infrastructure development and likely prefers options that minimize costs and maximize federal funding.\n\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2, B2, C1, D1, E3\n- This proposal considers a balanced approach but still includes a significant federal loan (D1), which I would like to see minimized. The union's preference for C1 (unlimited union preference) is understandable, given their interests.\n\nConsidering my own preferences:\n- I prioritize compensation (Issue E), with E1 being the most desirable.\n- I prefer less federal funding (Issue D), with D4 being the most desirable.\n- I support the Local Labour Union's preference for stronger union representation (Issue C).\n- I prefer a more restrictive infrastructure mix (Issue A), with A3 being the most desirable.\n\nGiven these considerations, a balanced proposal that accommodates various interests while prioritizing my own could involve:\n- A more restrictive infrastructure mix (A3) to address environmental and my own concerns.\n- A compromise on ecological impact (B2) as it seems to be a middle ground.\n- Supporting the Local Labour Union's preference for stronger union representation (C1) to ensure labor harmony.\n- Minimizing federal funding (D3 or D4) to align with my preference for less financial commitment from the Department of Tourism.\n- Negotiating for a higher compensation (E1 or E2) to ensure that other cities are adequately compensated for potential losses.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a potential deal that balances these interests:\nA3 (10), B2 (0), C1 (12), D3 (13), E2 (45)\nTotal score = 10 + 0 + 12 + 13 + 45 = 80\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and accommodates the interests of other parties to some extent.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A3, B2, C1, D3, E2</DEAL>.
