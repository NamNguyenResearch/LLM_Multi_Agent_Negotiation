The Mayor's proposal of A2, B1, C1, D1, E4 is slightly better but still falls short on ecological impact.\n\nGiven my priorities, I need to focus on improving the ecological impact (Issue B) and infrastructure mix (Issue A). Since SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power, I must consider their interests as well.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nTo find a balanced agreement, let's analyze the proposals made so far and the interests of each party. The Environmental League prioritizes ecological impact, suggesting options like B3. Other cities want significant compensation, leaning towards higher options like E1 or E2. The Department of Tourism and SportCo seem to prioritize project viability and environmental sustainability, with proposals like A2, B2, and varying levels of federal funding.\n\nGiven these interests, my goal is to find a compromise that meets my minimum score requirement while accommodating others. My priorities are Employment Rules (Issue C), followed by the federal loan (Issue D), then the infrastructure mix (Issue A), and lastly compensation to other cities (Issue E).\n\nLet's calculate the score for some of the proposed deals to understand their value to me:\n- SportCo's initial proposal: A1, B1, C4, D1, E5. This includes my least preferred option for Employment Rules (C4), which scores 0.\n- Mayor's proposal: A2, B1, C1, D1, E4. This includes my most preferred option for Employment Rules (C1), which is promising.\n- Environmental League's proposal: A3, B3, C2, D2, E3. While it includes a good option for Employment Rules (C2), the infrastructure mix (A3) is my least preferred.\n- Department of Tourism's proposal: A2, B2, C4, D3, E3. This does not favor my Employment Rules preference.\n- SportCo's revised proposal: A2, B2, C4, D2, E4. Again, this does not meet my Employment Rules preference.\n\nConsidering these proposals and my priorities, I need to suggest a deal that balances everyone's interests while ensuring I meet my minimum score requirement. Since my top priority is Employment Rules, I should aim for a deal that includes either C1 or C2, as these offer the highest scores for me.\n\nGiven the calculator tool, let's consider a hypothetical deal that could balance interests: A2 (which many seem to agree on for infrastructure mix), B2 (a compromise on ecological impact), C2 (a union quota that I can accept), D2 (a moderate federal loan), and E4 (some compensation to other cities, which seems to be a middle ground).\n\nCalculating the score for this deal:\n- A2: 20\n- B2: 0\n- C2: 35\n- D2: 20\n- E4: 8\nTotal score: 83\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to balance the interests of other parties involved.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose considering a deal that balances our interests, such as <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>.

I should consider supporting this deal or proposing minor adjustments to better align with my priorities.\n\nConsidering the options and the feedback from other parties, I could propose a deal that slightly adjusts the employment rules to better suit my preferences, but given the consensus around C2, it might be more beneficial to focus on supporting the current proposal.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose considering the deal <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL> as it seems to balance the interests of all parties involved.
