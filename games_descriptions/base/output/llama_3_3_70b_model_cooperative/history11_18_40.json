The Department of Tourism's interests are also crucial, and they might be keen on the federal loan aspect (D1).\n\nHowever, as the Environmental League, my primary concerns are the \"Infrastructure Mix\" (Issue A) and \"Ecological Impact\" (Issue B). I need to find a balance that accommodates SportCo's and the Department of Tourism's interests while meeting my minimum score requirement.\n\nLet's consider alternatives that could meet my minimum score of 55. Since my maximum score for Issue B is 55 and for Issue A is 45, I need to prioritize options that maximize these scores. Option B3 (Improve) and A3 (land-based) would be ideal, but given SportCo's initial stance, this might be challenging to achieve directly.\n\nA potential compromise could involve moving towards a more balanced infrastructure mix and reducing ecological damage. Since I don't have scores for Issues C, D, and E, I can be flexible with these, aiming to meet the other parties' needs.\n\nGiven the above, a potential deal that could be more acceptable to all parties, including myself, might involve compromising on the infrastructure mix and ecological impact while accommodating the other parties' preferences on employment rules, federal loan, and compensation to other cities.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose considering a deal that balances our environmental concerns with the needs of other parties, such as <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E2</DEAL>, which could be a stepping stone towards a more mutually beneficial agreement.
