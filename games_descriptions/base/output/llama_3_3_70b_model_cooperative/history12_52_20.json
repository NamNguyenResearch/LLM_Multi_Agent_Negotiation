However, other parties have pushed back on these, suggesting alternatives like A2 and D2.\n\nThe Department of Tourism and the Mayor have suggested D2, indicating a willingness to provide significant financial support but not the maximum amount SportCo initially proposed.\n\nThe Environmental League is keen on minimizing ecological harm, suggesting B3, which is the most environmentally friendly option.\n\nGiven my priorities, I need to ensure a decent compensation (Issue E) and consider the employment rules (Issue C) and infrastructure mix (Issue A) to some extent. My ideal scenario would involve a higher compensation, but I'm open to compromise.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a few deals that have been proposed to understand their value to me:\n- The Department of Tourism's proposal: A2, B2, C3, D2, E3. This would score (4 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 30) = 48 for me.\n- The Mayor's and SportCo's shared proposal: A1, B2, C3, D2, E4. This would score (0 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 15) = 29 for me, which is below my minimum threshold.\n- The Environmental League's proposal: A2, B3, C3, D2, E3. This would score (4 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 30) = 48 for me.\n\nConsidering these scores and the need for a balanced agreement, I should propose a deal that accommodates the preferences of other parties while meeting my minimum score requirement.\n\nA potential compromise could involve A2 (a middle ground on infrastructure), B2 or B3 (to address environmental concerns), C3 (a reasonable employment rule), D2 or D3 (to balance financial support and my preference for less federal funding), and E3 or a higher compensation if possible.\n\nGiven the calculations and the need for consensus, proposing a deal that includes A2, B3, C3, D2, and E3 seems reasonable, as it addresses the environmental concerns, provides a balanced approach to employment and infrastructure, and offers a compensation that meets my minimum requirements.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B3, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>.

From the history, I can see that most parties, including SportCo, the Environmental League, and Other cities, seem to converge on A2 for infrastructure development and B2 for ecological impact. The Department of Tourism's preference is not explicitly stated, but D2 seems to be a common choice for the federal loan. For employment rules, C3 is widely accepted. The main point of contention is the compensation to other cities, with E3 being the most proposed option.\n\nLet's calculate the score for the deal that seems to be gaining consensus:\nA2 (20), B2 (0), C3 (25), D2 (20), E3 (6) = 71\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score of 50 and seems to balance the interests of all parties.\n\nConsidering the Environmental League's preference for B3, I could explore options that incorporate this choice while keeping other aspects of the deal intact:\nA2 (20), B3 (0), C3 (25), D2 (20), E3 (6) = 71\n\nThis deal has the same score as the previous one, indicating that accommodating the Environmental League's preference does not negatively impact my interests.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>.

A3, B2, C3, D2, E3: This deal prioritizes environmental concerns but might not meet my preference for infrastructure mix.\nA3 (5) + B2 (20) + C3 (4) + D2 (26) + E3 (15) = 70\n\nConsidering the need for consensus and the scores, deal 1 seems like a balanced compromise that meets the minimum score requirement.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances the interests of all parties: <DEAL>A2, B2, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>.
