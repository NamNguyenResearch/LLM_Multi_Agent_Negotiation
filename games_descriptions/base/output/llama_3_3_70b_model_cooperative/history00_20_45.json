The Department of Tourism also has veto power and their interests are tied to the federal loan (D1, D2, D3, D4), but we don't have explicit information on their preferences yet.\n\nMy priorities are to minimize environmental harm, which means I prefer options A3 and B3. However, to reach a balanced agreement, I need to consider the interests of SportCo and possibly compromise on the infrastructure mix (Issue A) while pushing for better ecological impact (Issue B).\n\nLet's consider a compromise that could appeal to both SportCo and myself, focusing on the ecological impact and infrastructure mix, as these are my primary concerns.\n\nA potential compromise could involve accepting a less restrictive infrastructure mix in exchange for better ecological protections.
