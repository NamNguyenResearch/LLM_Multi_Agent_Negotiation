To understand the potential for adjustment, let's consider the scores for these deals:\n- For <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E3 (30) = 50\n- For <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E4 (15) = 35\n\nHowever, considering my scoring system, E4 actually scores 15, not a higher score. The correct calculation for <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL> should be:\n- A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E4 (15) = 35\n\nBut given the context, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation. The correct score for E4 should be higher than E3, as per the initial scoring provided:\n- E1 (60), E2 (45), E3 (30), E4 (15), E5 (0)\n\nThus, the correct score for <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL> should actually be calculated with the correct score for E4, which is indeed lower than E3.
