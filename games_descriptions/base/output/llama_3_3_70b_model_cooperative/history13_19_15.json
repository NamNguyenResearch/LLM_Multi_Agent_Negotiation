The Department of Tourism proposed a deal with A2, B3, C2, D3, E2, which shows they are willing to compromise on the infrastructure mix and ecological impact. The Environmental League proposed a deal with A2, B3, C2, D2, E2, indicating they prioritize ecological impact. The Local Labour Union, Mayor, and Other cities proposed deals with A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, showing they are willing to compromise on employment rules and compensation.\n\nLet's calculate the scores for the proposed deals:\n- Department of Tourism's deal: A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D3 (20) + E2 (5) = 38\n- Environmental League's deal: A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 47\n- Local Labour Union's deal: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 54\n- Mayor's deal: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 54\n- Other cities' deal: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 54\n\nConsidering the proposals and scores, a potential compromise could be: A2, B2, C2, D2, E2. This deal balances the infrastructure mix, maintains ecological balance, has a union quota, provides a $2 billion federal loan, and offers $450 million in compensation to other cities.\n\nCalculating the score for this potential compromise:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 54\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and accommodates the interests of multiple parties.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose the deal <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E2</DEAL> as it seems to balance the needs of all parties involved.
