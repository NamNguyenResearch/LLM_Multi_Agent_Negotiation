The Local Labour Union and Mayor have shown support for B2, while I and the Local Labour Union in the last turn have expressed interest in B3 for better environmental protection.\n\nMy priority remains maximizing environmental protection without compromising on infrastructure mix. Since A2 is widely accepted, I'll focus on B. B3 is my preferred option, but I see that B2 is also widely supported.\n\nLet's consider the scores for a deal that could meet my minimum requirement while accommodating others:\n- A2 (22) for infrastructure mix, as it's a compromise between water-based and land-based.\n- B2 (25) for ecological impact, as it's a middle ground that many parties seem to accept.\n- For other issues, I remain flexible since they don't affect my score directly.\n\nA potential deal could be <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>, which seems to balance the interests of all parties involved. However, I must ensure that my minimum score is met. If I consider B3 (55), it already meets my minimum score on its own, but I need to see if others can accept it.\n\nGiven the Local Labour Union's last proposal was <DEAL>A2, B3, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>, it seems there might be support for B3 among some parties.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a deal that balances environmental protection and other parties' interests: <DEAL>A2, B3, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>. This compromise prioritizes environmental protection while accommodating the preferences of other parties. I believe this deal can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nNext, I will explore options around adjusting C, D, or E if B3 is not acceptable to all parties, to find a compromise that meets my minimum score while considering others' preferences. Specifically, I might consider adjusting E to E3 or E2 to see if it can help win over Other cities, or adjusting D to D3 to reduce the federal loan's impact on the Department of Tourism's budget.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nI propose a deal that balances environmental protection and other parties' interests: <DEAL>A2, B3, C2, D2, E4</DEAL>.

Given the strong consensus on A2, B3, C2, and D2, and the fact that E2 provides a significant compensation to other cities, I believe this deal can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nOthers seem to prefer A2, B3, C2, and are open to discussing D and E.
