The employment rules have seen proposals ranging from C2 to C3, suggesting flexibility. The federal loan has been proposed at D2 and D3, indicating a potential compromise. Compensation to other cities has been proposed at E3 and E4, showing a willingness to negotiate.\n\nMy priorities are maximizing the federal loan (D1), minimizing compensation to other cities (E5), having no union preference (C4), opting for a water-based infrastructure mix (A1), and accepting some ecological damage (B1). However, I must be flexible to reach an agreement.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a potential compromise deal that considers the common proposals and my priorities:\n- A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 64\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and considers the interests of multiple parties.\n\nConsidering the need for a balanced agreement and the importance of accommodating others' preferences, I could propose a deal that meets my minimum score while also considering the interests of other parties. For instance, compromising on the ecological impact, employment rules, and compensation to other cities while prioritizing the federal loan could be a way forward.\n\nA potential compromise could involve options like A2 (to balance infrastructure development), B3 (to address environmental concerns), C3 (to support the Local Labour Union), D2 (to secure a significant federal loan), and E3 (to offer fair compensation to other cities).\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a compromise deal: <DEAL>A2, B3, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>.
