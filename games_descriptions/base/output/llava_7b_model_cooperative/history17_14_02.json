Therefore, I propose a compromise deal that accommodates the preferences of each party while ensuring that the minimum score of 30 is met.\n\nFor the infrastructure mix issue (A), I suggest option A2, which allows for some water-based buildings but with restrictions. This option balances SportCo's desire for flexibility in building facilities and the Environmental League's concerns about the ecological impact.\n\nRegarding the ecological impact issue (B), I propose option B2, which maintains the balance of local dolphins and sea lion populations. This option shows that we are not anti-environment and are willing to take special precautions to minimize any potential harm caused by the project.\n\nFor the employment rules issue (C), I suggest option C1, which gives unlimited preference to the Local Labour Union. This option ensures that the union's concerns are addressed while maintaining a balanced agreement.\n\nAs for the federal loan issue (D), I propose option D3, which provides a $1 billion loan from the Department of Tourism. This option is more feasible than D1 and still allows for substantial funding to support the project.\n\nFinally, for the compensation to other cities issue (E), I suggest option E4, which pays $150 million to \"Other cities.\" This option shows that we are willing to provide some compensation while avoiding upsetting people in this issue.\n\nOverall, this deal balances the interests of all parties involved and is more likely to lead to an agreement.
