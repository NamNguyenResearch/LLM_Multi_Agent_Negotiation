Let's evaluate this proposal based on my scoring preferences:\n\nA1 (14) + B1 (12) + C4 (0) + D1 (40) + E5 (10) = 76\n\nThis proposal scores 76 points for me, which is well above my minimum threshold of 30. However, there are areas where I can improve the score, particularly regarding the employment rules (Issue C). I prefer C1, which would give me the full 24 points for that issue. \n\nI need to consider the preferences of the other parties as well. The Environmental League will likely oppose B1 and possibly A1. The Local Labour Union will oppose C4. The Department of Tourism's preferences are unknown, but they are crucial as they need to agree for the proposal to pass. Other cities' preferences are also unknown, but they will likely oppose E5.\n\nMy strategy should be to maintain A1, B1, and D1, as these are high-scoring for me and SportCo seems to support them. I should push for C1 to maximize my score with the Local Labour Union. I can compromise on E, as it is the least important issue to me, and moving from E5 to E4 or E3 could help gain support from other cities without significantly affecting my score.\n\nI will propose a deal that changes C4 to C1 and possibly E5 to E4 or E3 to gain broader support while maintaining or improving my score.\n\nCalculating the new score with the preferred C1 and a compromise on E:\n\nA1 (14) + B1 (12) + C1 (24) + D1 (40) + E4 (7) = 97\nA1 (14) + B1 (12) + C1 (24) + D1 (40) + E3 (4) = 94\n\nBoth options are still above my minimum threshold and would likely be more palatable to the Local Labour Union and other cities.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI believe we should ensure that the local community benefits directly from the employment opportunities this project will create.
