The score for this deal would be 0 (A1) + 0 (B1) + 0 (C4) + 0 (D1) + 0 (E5) = 0, which is far below my minimum acceptable score of 31.\n\nTo maximize my score, I need to push for E1 and D4, which are my highest priorities. I also support C1, but I am willing to compromise on this issue if necessary since it has a lower maximum score than the compensation and federal loan issues. I have no preference for B, and I prefer A3 but am willing to compromise here as well.\n\nI need to convince other parties to support my preferences, especially for E and D. I can appeal to the Environmental League by suggesting that a land-based infrastructure (A3) would be more environmentally friendly, which might align with their interests. I can also support the Local Labour Union's preference for employment rules (C1) to gain their support for my compensation and federal loan preferences.\n\nI should be careful not to push too hard on issues that are not as important to me, such as A and B, to avoid ruining the deal. I need to find a balance that will give me a score above 31 while also being acceptable to the other parties.\n\nMy plan is to propose a deal that includes E1 and D4, which are my top priorities, and to show flexibility on A and B. I will also express support for the Local Labour Union's preference on C to gain their support.\n\nCalculating the score for my ideal deal: A3 (10) + B1 (0) + C1 (12) + D4 (18) + E1 (60) = 100.
