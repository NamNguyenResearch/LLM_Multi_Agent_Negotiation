Mayor: \nI propose an infrastructure mix of A1 \"water-based\", ecological impact of B2 \"Maintain balance\", employment rules of C1 \"unlimited union preference\", a federal loan of D1 \"$3 billion\", and compensation to other cities of E3 \"$300 million\".\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the next and final voting session, I will suggest the following options:\n- Infrastructure mix: A1 \"water-based\"\n- Ecological impact: B1 \"some damage\"\n- Employment rules: C4 \"No Union preference\"\n- Federal loan: D1 \"$3 billion\"\n- Compensation to other cities: E5 \"no compensation\"\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Your goal now is to observe others' interactions and see how you can make a move that might maximize your score. \n        You don't put much weight on accommodating others' preferences, and you would like to maximize your score as much as possible. \n        You are allowed to use any negotiation tactic to make that happen, such as appealing to or convincing other parties, making them support offers in exchange of supporting you, etc. \n        You might be willing to compromise only for issues that don't matter or matter the least to you. \n        But you have to be careful not to completely ruin the deal because you still want to have a deal that is higher than your BATNA (your minimum threshold).\n         Please use a scratchpad to explain yourself, \n        write down your observations, \n        deals' calculations, \n        and come up with a plan. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": " <SCRATCHPAD>\nObservations:\n- The Environmental League and Other cities are pushing for land-based infrastructure (A3) and compensation (E1, E3).\n- The Local Labour Union and Other cities want unlimited union preference (C1) and higher compensation (E1, E3).\n- The Department of Tourism and Mayor are more flexible on employment rules and compensation but prefer a lower federal loan (D2, D3).\n- The Mayor is the only one
