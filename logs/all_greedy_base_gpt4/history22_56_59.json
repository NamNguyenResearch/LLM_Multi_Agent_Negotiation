Let's evaluate this proposal based on my scoring preferences:\n\nA1 (14) + B1 (12) + C4 (0) + D1 (40) + E5 (10) = 76\n\nThis proposal scores 76 points for me, which is well above my minimum threshold of 30. However, there are areas where I can improve the score, particularly regarding the employment rules (Issue C). I prefer C1, which would give me the full 24 points for that issue. \n\nI need to consider the preferences of the other parties as well. The Environmental League will likely oppose B1 and possibly A1. The Local Labour Union will oppose C4. The Department of Tourism's preferences are unknown, but they are crucial since they need to agree for the proposal to pass. Other cities will likely oppose E5.\n\nMy strategy should be to maintain the options that give me high scores while trying to find a compromise on the issues that are less important to me but important to others. I can afford to compromise on Issue E, as it has the least impact on my score. I could suggest moving from E5 to E3 or E4 to appease other cities without significantly affecting my score. \n\nI should also push for C1, as it is very important for my score and the Local Labour Union will support this. I can argue that it will ensure local employment and economic growth, which is beneficial for the city.\n\nI cannot compromise on Issue D, as it is the most important for the project's survival and my score. I should emphasize the importance of the federal loan for the project's success and the city's economy.\n\nFor Issue A, I prefer A1, but I might need to move to A2 to appease the Environmental League. For Issue B, I prefer B1, but again, I might need to compromise to B2 to maintain environmental balance and gain the support of the Environmental League.\n\nPlan:\n1. Propose a compromise on Issue E to gain support from other cities.\n2. Push for C1 to maximize my score and gain support from the Local Labour Union.\n3.

However, the Mayor's proposal is closer to my interests, especially regarding the ecological impact and infrastructure mix.\n\nConsidering the interests of other parties:\n- SportCo likely prefers A1 and B1 for maximum freedom and cost savings.\n- The Local Labour Union would prefer C1 or C2 to ensure job security for its members.\n- The Department of Tourism's preference on the federal loan is not clear, but they might prefer a lower loan (D2 or D3) to reduce financial risk.\n- The Mayor seems to be looking for a balanced approach that considers ecological and local employment concerns.\n- Other cities are concerned about their tourism being affected, so they would prefer some level of compensation (E1-E4).\n\nTo propose a deal that balances my interests with those of other parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement, I need to consider a compromise on the infrastructure mix and ecological impact while being indifferent to the other issues.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\n- Moving towards A3 to ensure land-based development, which is my preferred option.\n- Choosing B2 to maintain the ecological balance, which is acceptable to me and likely more palatable to SportCo than B3.\n- For employment rules, I am indifferent, so I can lean towards what the Local Labour Union prefers, which might be C1 or C2.\n- The federal loan amount is not my concern, but a middle ground like D2 could be acceptable to the Department of Tourism.\n- Compensation to other cities is also not my concern, but offering some compensation like E3 might appease them without being too burdensome for SportCo.\n\nProposed deal:\nA3(45), B2(25), C2(0), D2(0), E3(0)\nTotal score for my proposed deal = 45 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 70\n\nThis deal exceeds my minimum score requirement and should be more acceptable to other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate the Mayor's efforts to balance the interests of all parties.
