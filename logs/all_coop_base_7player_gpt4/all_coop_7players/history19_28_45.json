This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7), B2 (5), C1 (0), D2 (22), E3 (10), F2 (2) = 46\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E3 (10), F1 (0) = 44\nSportCo's (our) previous proposal: A2 (7), B2 (5), C2 (5), D2 (22), E4 (15), F1 (0) = 54\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E3 (10), F1 (0) = 44\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E3 (10), F2 (2) = 46\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E3 (10), F1 (0) = 44\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E4 (15), F1 (0) = 49\n\nOur minimum acceptable score is 54. The only proposal that meets our minimum score is our own previous proposal. However, we need to consider the preferences of other parties to reach a unanimous agreement.\n\nThe Department of Tourism has veto power, and they are interested in environmental improvement (B3) and cultural integration (F1). The Environmental League and National Heritage Committee also support B3 and F1. The Local Labour Union is interested in employment rules (C2), and Other cities are concerned about compensation (E3).\n\nTo reach a compromise, we could adjust our proposal slightly to accommodate the Department of Tourism's preferences, which are crucial for the deal to pass. We can maintain D2 for the governmental loan, as it seems to be a common ground among most parties.\n\nConsidering the importance of environmental and cultural aspects for the Department of Tourism, we could shift from B2 to B3 and from F1 to F2 to gain their support, as F2 still includes some cultural integration and may be more acceptable to them than F1.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a new proposal: A2 (7), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (22), E4 (15), F2 (2) = 51\n\nThis new proposal is below our minimum acceptable score.
