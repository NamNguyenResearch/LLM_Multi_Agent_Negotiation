Local Labour Union: \nAfter considering everyone's input and aiming for a balanced agreement that meets our common interests, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>. This compromise respects the ecological and cultural concerns while ensuring fair employment distribution and a reasonable governmental loan.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I will propose the following options:\n- Maintain A2 for infrastructure mix as it is a middle ground.\n- Keep B2 for ecological impact to satisfy environmental concerns.\n- Stick with C3 for employment rules to balance union and non-union employment.\n- Insist on D2 for the governmental loan as it is critical for the project's funding.\n- Propose E3 for compensation to other cities as a fair amount.\n- Suggest F2 for cultural integration to include moderate cultural elements.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F3 (8) = 62\nMy previous plan: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\nNational Heritage Committee & Environmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 48\nDepartment of Tourism's agreement: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 48\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 45\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 56\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's veto power and their agreement with the National Heritage Committee & Environmental League's proposal, it is crucial to align with them.
