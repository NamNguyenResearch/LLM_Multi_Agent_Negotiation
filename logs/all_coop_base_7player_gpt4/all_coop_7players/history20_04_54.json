This strikes a balance between economic investment, environmental protection, cultural integration, and fair employment practices.\n \n . Local Labour Union: \nAfter considering everyone's positions, I suggest we go with a deal that ensures strong employment terms for our union, supports cultural heritage, and balances economic investment. I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C1, D2, E3, F1 </DEAL>. This reflects a balanced approach that respects the key priorities of all parties involved.\n \n . Other cities: \nAfter considering everyone's positions and the need for a balanced agreement, I propose we finalize the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E2, F2 </DEAL>. This reflects a fair compromise on employment, a reasonable governmental loan, fair compensation for other cities, and a moderate approach to cultural integration.\n \n . You (SportCo): \nAfter careful consideration and in the spirit of compromise, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D1, E3, F2 </DEAL>. This balanced proposal addresses the key concerns of all parties while ensuring the project's success.\n \n . Environmental League: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3, F1 </DEAL>. This proposal respects environmental and cultural priorities while offering a fair compromise on employment and economic investment.\n \n . Department of Tourism: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' preferences and the need for a balanced agreement, I support the deal proposed by the Environmental League: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3, F1 </DEAL>. This proposal respects our shared environmental and cultural values while offering a fair compromise on employment and economic investment.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions.

This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 65\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 59\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 49\nSportCo's (my) previous proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 62\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\nDepartment of Tourism's supported proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\n\nBased on the Department of Tourism's support, it seems that D2 is a more likely option than D1.
