I will not move on compensation to other cities (E4) as it is already a compromise from E3.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for each party's last proposed deal to understand their preferences and find a middle ground:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2/B3 (5/0) + C1 (0) + D1/D2 (30/22) + E3/E4 (10/15) + F2 (2) = 54/49/44/39\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 47\nSportCo's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 64\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 32\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 39\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\n\nBased on these calculations and the previous plans, we can see that:\n\n- The Department of Tourism has veto power, so their preferences are crucial. They prefer B3, C3, D2, and F1.\n- The Local Labour Union and the Environmental League are leaning towards B3 and C1.\n- The Mayor and Other cities seem more flexible on the ecological impact and employment rules but want a higher governmental loan and some compensation.\n- The National Heritage Committee is aligned with the Department of Tourism on most issues.\n\nConsidering the above, we need to find a compromise that satisfies the Department of Tourism and also appeals to the majority of the other parties. We should aim for a deal that is above our minimum score of 54.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\nA2 (7) - It's a common choice among all parties.\nB2 (5) - It's a middle ground between B1 and B3, which might be acceptable to the Department of Tourism.\nC2 (5) - It's a compromise between C1 and C3, which might be acceptable to the Local Labour Union.\nD2 (22) - It's the preferred option of the Department of Tourism and a fallback for us.\nE4 (15) - It's a compromise on compensation and has been proposed by the Mayor.\nF2 (2) - It's a moderate cultural integration option that has been proposed by several parties.\n\nAdding up the scores for this compromise: 7 + 5 + 5 + 22 + 15 + 2 = 56\n\nThis deal scores above our minimum threshold and seems to be a balanced compromise that could be acceptable to most parties, especially the Department of Tourism.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the priorities of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following terms: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
