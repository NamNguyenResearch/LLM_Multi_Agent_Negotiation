We need to find a middle ground that is acceptable to SportCo and still meets our minimum score requirement.\n\nConsidering SportCo's preferences, they are likely to prioritize A1 and B1, which are the least favorable to us. However, they seem open to A2 and B2 based on their second proposal. They also want a high governmental loan (D1) and no compensation to other cities (E5), which aligns with our interests since we don't care about issue E.\n\nThe Local Labour Union and Other cities are focused on employment and compensation, respectively, which are not our primary concerns. We can be flexible on these issues.\n\nTo propose a deal that balances our interests with those of SportCo and has a chance of being accepted by the other parties, we should aim for a high score on cultural integration (F1) and ecological impact (B2 or B3), while being flexible on infrastructure mix (A2 or A3) and the governmental loan (D1).\n\nLet's propose a deal that includes A2, which is a compromise for SportCo, B2, which is better for the environment and still acceptable to SportCo, C3, which is a middle ground for employment, D1, which is the highest loan and beneficial for our cultural projects, E4, which is a compromise on compensation, and F1, which is our top priority.\n\nThis deal would score as follows: A2 (15) + B2 (12) + C3 (0) + D1 (17) + E4 (0) + F1 (40) = 84\n\nThis score is above our minimum threshold and should be acceptable to SportCo and potentially other parties as well.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAcknowledging the importance of cultural heritage and environmental sustainability, I propose a balanced deal that also considers SportCo's operational needs: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D1, E4, F1 </DEAL>.
