However, we should aim to increase the score while also accommodating other parties' preferences.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, we can infer that:\n- The Environmental League is highly focused on ecological impact (B3) and cultural integration (F1).\n- The Local Labour Union and the National Heritage Committee seem to be aligned on employment rules (C2) and cultural integration (F1).\n- The Department of Tourism has not expressed a strong preference for the governmental loan amount, suggesting some flexibility there.\n\nTo propose a deal that balances our interests with those of other parties and is more likely to lead to an agreement, we could consider the following adjustments:\n- Accept a compromise on the infrastructure mix (A2) as it has been consistently proposed by other parties.\n- Move towards a middle ground on ecological impact (B2), which is acceptable to us and has been proposed by several parties.\n- Offer a compromise on employment rules (C3), which is closer to our preference and has been accepted by the Department of Tourism.\n- Aim for a higher governmental loan (D2), which is crucial for us and has been proposed by multiple parties.\n- Propose a lower compensation to other cities (E4), which aligns with our interests and has been proposed by the Mayor.\n- Suggest a moderate level of cultural integration (F2), which is a compromise from our initial preference but still shows our willingness to integrate cultural aspects.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this adjusted proposal:\nAdjusted proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\n\nThis proposal meets our minimum score requirement and takes into account the preferences of other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAcknowledging the valuable input from all parties, I propose a balanced deal that respects our shared interests: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
