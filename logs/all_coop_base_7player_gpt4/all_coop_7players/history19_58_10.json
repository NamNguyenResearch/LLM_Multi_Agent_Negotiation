The total score for this deal would be 0 + 0 + 14 + 36 + 5 + 10 = 65. This score is above my minimum threshold of 41, but it does not align well with my preferences, especially regarding the infrastructure mix (A) and ecological impact (B).\n\nNow, let's consider the preferences of the other parties based on their proposals and try to find a middle ground:\n\n- SportCo has agreed with my initial proposal, which is a good sign for the financial aspect (D1) and employment rules (C2).\n- The Environmental League is very concerned about the environmental impact (A3, B3) and less about the financial aspects.\n- The Department of Tourism has agreed with my initial proposal, which is aligned with SportCo's financial considerations.\n- The Local Labour Union has shown flexibility but insists on a better deal for other cities (E4).\n- The National Heritage Committee wants a stronger focus on cultural integration (F1).\n\nConsidering these preferences, I need to adjust my proposal to accommodate the Environmental League without losing the support of SportCo and the Department of Tourism. I also need to consider the Local Labour Union's and National Heritage Committee's preferences.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\n- Infrastructure Mix (A2): This is a middle ground that respects environmental concerns and allows some water-based construction.\n- Ecological Impact (B2): This maintains a balance for the environment while not being too restrictive for SportCo.\n- Employment Rules (C2): This keeps the Local Labour Union on board with a fair distribution of jobs.\n- Governmental Loan (D1): This is crucial for the project's success and has support from key parties.\n- Compensation to Other Cities (E3): This offers some compensation without being too high, which might be acceptable to other cities.\n- Cultural Integration and Preservation (F2): This shows respect for cultural heritage without incurring significant costs.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this new compromise: A2 (7), B2 (6), C2 (14), D1 (36), E3 (4), F2 (10).
