For compensation to other cities, E3 is a middle ground that is acceptable to SportCo and might be a compromise for other cities. For cultural integration, F2 is a compromise between SportCo's preference and the concerns of the National Heritage Committee.\n\nTo reach a consensus, I will propose a deal that tries to balance the preferences of all parties while ensuring that SportCo's score remains above the minimum threshold of 54.\n\nProposed deal calculation:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis deal meets the minimum threshold and seems to be a balanced compromise that may be acceptable to all parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the concerns and preferences of all parties, I propose a balanced deal that aims to meet our collective interests: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3, F2 </DEAL>.
