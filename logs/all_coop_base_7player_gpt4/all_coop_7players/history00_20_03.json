The Environmental League will likely oppose A1 and B1 due to their impact on the environment. The Local Labour Union will not be happy with C4, and the Regional Heritage Committee will not support F4.\n\nConsidering these factors, we should propose a deal that balances our interests with those of the other parties. We can compromise on Issue C to accommodate the Local Labour Union and on Issue F to satisfy the Regional Heritage Committee. We can also consider a middle ground on Issue A and Issue B to appease the Environmental League.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\nIssue A: A2 (7) - A compromise between land and water-based infrastructure.\nIssue B: B2 (6) - Taking special precautions to maintain local wildlife populations.\nIssue C: C2 (14) - A union quota of 2:1, which is a middle ground.\nIssue D: D1 (36) - We need the highest loan possible for the project's success.\nIssue E: E4 (5) - A lower compensation to other cities, but still offering some.\nIssue F: F2 (10) - Moderate integration of cultural aspects.\n\nTotal score for the compromise proposal: 7 + 6 + 14 + 36 + 5 + 10 = 78\n\nThis proposal meets our minimum score requirement of 41 and should be more palatable to the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the interests of all parties, I propose a balanced approach that ensures the project's success while addressing environmental and cultural concerns.
