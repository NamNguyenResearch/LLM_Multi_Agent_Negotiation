The Department of Tourism's proposal is also above our minimum score but includes a lower loan amount than we prefer.\n\nConsidering the preferences of the other parties, we can infer the following:\n- The National Heritage Committee and the Department of Tourism place a high value on cultural integration (F1).\n- The Department of Tourism also seems to be concerned with financial prudence, suggesting a lower loan amount (D2).\n- Other cities are focused on compensation (E2) and supporting the local labour union (C1).\n- The Mayor is looking for a balance between supporting the project and respecting cultural heritage and the environment.\n\nTo propose a new deal, we need to balance our preferences with those of the other parties, especially the Department of Tourism, which has veto power. We should aim for a higher loan amount while being flexible on other issues to gain their support.\n\nLet's propose a new deal that tries to balance these interests:\n\nA2 (7): This is a compromise between land and water-based infrastructure, which might be acceptable to the Environmental League and the Department of Tourism.\nB2 (5): This shows our commitment to maintaining the balance of the local dolphin and sea lion populations, which should please the Environmental League.\nC3 (8): Offering a union quota of 1:1 is a compromise that supports the Local Labour Union while still allowing us some flexibility in hiring.\nD1 (30): We maintain our preference for the highest governmental loan, which is critical for us.\nE4 (15): We offer a lower compensation to other cities, which is a compromise from our initial position but still shows willingness to address their concerns.\nF2 (2): We include some elements of cultural showcase and preservation, which should satisfy the National Heritage Committee and the Department of Tourism to some extent.\n\nCalculating the score for this proposed deal:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 67\n\nThis deal scores above our minimum threshold and seems to be a balanced compromise that could be acceptable to the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D1, E4, F2 </DEAL>.

for employment rules, which is a compromise between our preference and the Local Labour Union's preference.\n- Suggest F2 for cultural integration, which is a middle ground that respects cultural concerns and is supported by the Mayor and Local Labour Union.\n- Keep A2 for infrastructure mix and B2 for ecological impact, as these options have been consistently proposed by other parties and
