However, I need to consider SportCo's preferences as they have veto power. They initially proposed A1, B1, C4, D1, E5, F4. It's likely that they prefer less restriction on building (A1), less concern for ecological impact (B1), no union preference (C4), the highest governmental loan (D1), no compensation to other cities (E5), and no action on cultural integration (F4). \n\nGiven that SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power, I need to find a compromise that includes their preferences but also meets my minimum score. I should aim for a high score in F (Cultural Integration and Preservation) and D (Governmental Loan) since these are more likely to be within my influence and also align with the Department of Tourism's interests in promoting culture.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's proposal, which is quite favorable to my interests, I should try to adjust it slightly to make it more appealing to SportCo without dropping below my minimum score.

The Mayor is looking for a balance between local employment, environmental, and cultural concerns.\n\nConsidering these preferences and the scores, we need to find a compromise that will be above our minimum score of 54 while also appealing to the other parties.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\n- A2: It's a middle ground for infrastructure, which the Department of Tourism and National Heritage Committee seem to prefer.\n- B2: This shows a commitment to the environment, which is important to the Department of Tourism and National Heritage Committee.\n- C3: A balance in employment that may be acceptable to the Local Labour Union and the Mayor.\n- D1: The highest loan, which is critical for us and supported by the National Heritage Committee and the Mayor.\n- E3: A middle ground for compensation to Other cities.\n- F2: Some cultural integration, which is a compromise between our preference and the National Heritage Committee's.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this compromise:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 62\n\nThis proposal scores above our minimum threshold and seems to align with the preferences of the other parties to some extent.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate everyone's input and propose a balanced compromise that addresses our collective concerns.

However, it's right on the edge, and any further concessions could drop us below our threshold.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's proposal, which is crucial due to their veto power, we see they are leaning towards a smaller loan (D2) and have a preference for B3 and F1, which are both scoring 0 for us. We need to find a middle ground that keeps our score above 54 while accommodating their preferences.\n\nGiven the importance of the loan (D1) to us, we should try to keep it at $3 billion if possible. However, we may need to compromise on other issues to ensure the Department of Tourism's support.\n\nWe can consider shifting from B2 to B3 to satisfy the Environmental League and the Department of Tourism, but we would need to make up for the score loss elsewhere. Since the Department of Tourism prefers C2, we can shift from C3 to C2, which is a small concession for us.\n\nFor cultural integration (F), we prefer F4, but we can consider moving to F2 to gain support from the National Heritage Committee and the Department of Tourism.\n\nLet's propose a new deal that tries to balance these considerations:\n\nA2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis deal meets our minimum score requirement and seems to align with the preferences of the Department of Tourism and the Environmental League.
