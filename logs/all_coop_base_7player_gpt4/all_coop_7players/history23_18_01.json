We need to find a compromise that includes their preferences while still meeting our minimum score threshold.\n\nConsidering SportCo's preferences, we might need to move from A2 to A1, which would lower our score by 15 points. However, we can't afford to move from B2 to B1 because that would lower our score by another 12 points, which would put us below our minimum threshold. We need to maintain B2 or B3 to stay above 50.\n\nTo increase the attractiveness of the deal for SportCo, we could propose a higher governmental loan (D1), which would also benefit us.

We prefer B1, but we might need to compromise to B2 for a higher score.

Since the governmental loan is our critical issue, we should aim to keep it as high as possible (D1 or D2).
