Therefore, I cannot agree to this deal. Now, I need to propose a new deal that is more aligned with my preferences while also considering the preferences of other parties.\n\nBased on the preferences provided, I will aim for the following options:\n\n- For Issue A, I prefer A2 (9), which is a compromise between environmental concerns and development freedom.\n- For Issue B, I prefer B3 (18) to protect the environment.\n- For Issue C, I prefer C4 (7), but I'm willing to compromise to C3 (4) if necessary.\n- For Issue D, I prefer D3 (28) as it represents the lowest non-zero loan I'm willing to offer.\n- For Issue E, I prefer E3 (12), which I believe is a fair compensation to other cities.\n- For Issue F, I prefer F1 (26) to ensure cultural integration and preservation.\n\nNow, let's construct a new deal based on these preferences:\n\nA2 (9) + B3 (18) + C3 (4) + D3 (28) + E3 (12) + F1 (26) = 97\n\nThis deal has a total score of 97, which is well above my minimum threshold.

For compensation to other cities (E), there is a range from E2 to E4, but again, since my committee does not have a preference, I can be flexible.\n\nGiven that my primary concern is cultural integration (F), I should advocate for F1, which has the highest score for my committee.
