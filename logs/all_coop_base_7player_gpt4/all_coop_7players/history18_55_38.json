However, SportCo has veto power, and their preferences must be considered. Since SportCo proposed D2, it's likely that they are willing to accept a lower loan than the $3 billion they initially asked for. They also seem to prefer a more balanced approach to employment (C3) and less compensation to other cities (E4).\n\nTo accommodate SportCo's preferences while maintaining your own interests, you could propose a deal that includes their preferred employment rules (C3) and compensation (E4), while keeping the other aspects aligned with the Environmental League's proposal, which you and they both favor.\n\nProposed Deal:\nA2 (9) + B3 (18) + C3 (4) + D2 (17) + E4 (10) + F1 (26) = 84\n\nThis deal maintains the high priority items for you (B3, D2, F1) while giving SportCo their preferred options on C and E, which are less important to you.

However, the National Heritage Committee and the Environmental League are pushing for a higher ecological impact and cultural integration, which lowers the score significantly.\n\nTo reach a compromise, I need to consider the preferences of the other parties while ensuring my score stays above 41. It seems that A2 is a common ground for infrastructure mix, and B2 is a reasonable compromise for ecological impact. For employment, C2 is preferred by the Mayor and the Local Labour Union, and it's a middle ground. D1 is crucial for the project's success, and I need to insist on it. E4 seems to be acceptable to most parties, and F2 is a good compromise for cultural integration.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D1, E4, and F2.

This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A3 (0) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 40\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 55\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 57\nSportCo's (my) previous plan: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D1 (30) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 62\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 37\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\n\nBased on these calculations, the National Heritage Committee's proposal and the Mayor's proposal are the closest to my minimum acceptable score of 54, but they both include B3, which has a score of 0 for me. My previous plan has a score of 62, which is above my minimum threshold.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's veto power and their preference for a moderate loan (D2), I might need to adjust the governmental loan down from D1 to D2 to secure their approval. However, I need to compensate for the lost points elsewhere to stay above my minimum score.\n\nI will propose a deal that includes A2, which seems to be a common ground for infrastructure, B2 for ecological impact, which is a middle ground and acceptable to the Department of Tourism, C3 for employment rules, which is supported by most parties, D2 for the governmental loan to secure the Department of Tourism's approval, E3 for compensation to other cities, which is a middle ground, and F2 for cultural integration, which is a compromise between no action and comprehensive integration.\n\nLet's calculate the score for my new proposal:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis proposal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to be a balanced compromise that could be acceptable to all parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration and in the spirit of compromise, I propose the following balanced deal that I
