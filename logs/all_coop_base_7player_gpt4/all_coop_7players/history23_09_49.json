They seem to prefer a moderate government loan (D2 or D3) and are very interested in cultural integration (F1).\n- The Local Labour Union is pushing for C1, which is not ideal for SportCo.\n- Other cities are interested in higher compensation (E2), but SportCo prefers E3 or E4.\n- The National Heritage Committee is interested in comprehensive cultural integration (F1).\n\nTo find a middle ground, SportCo could consider adjusting the proposal to accommodate the Department of Tourism's preference for cultural integration and a moderate government loan, as their approval is crucial. We could also move slightly towards the Local Labour Union's preference for employment rules, but not all the way to C1.\n\nA potential new proposal could be:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\n\nThis proposal does not meet SportCo's minimum score.

This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 51\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 37\nSportCo's previous proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 56\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 41\n\nBased on these calculations, the only proposals that meet SportCo's minimum score of 54 are the Mayor's and SportCo's previous proposals. However, the Mayor's proposal is below the threshold.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's veto power, it's crucial to keep the governmental loan at D2. The Department of Tourism and National Heritage Committee both prefer F1, but this is not acceptable to SportCo. However, they might be willing to compromise on F2, which is still a moderate integration of cultural aspects.\n\nThe Local Labour Union strongly prefers C1, but this is not acceptable to SportCo. A compromise at C2 might be more acceptable to both parties.\n\nThe Environmental League's preference for B3 is the lowest priority for SportCo, but it might be necessary to move to B2 to reach an agreement.\n\nTo reach a consensus, I will propose a deal that includes the preferred options of the Department of Tourism and National Heritage Committee where possible, while also considering the preferences of the Environmental League and Local Labour Union.\n\nProposed deal:\nA2 (7) - Balances infrastructure development.\nB2 (5) - Maintains ecological balance.\nC2 (5) - Fair employment ratio.\nD2 (22) - Ensures Department of Tourism's approval.\nE4 (15) - Fair compensation to other cities.\nF2 (2) - Moderate cultural integration.\n\nTotal score for this proposed deal: 7 + 5 + 5 + 22 + 15 + 2 = 56\n\nThis proposal meets SportCo's minimum score requirement and seems to be a balanced compromise that could be acceptable to the majority of the parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following compromise: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
