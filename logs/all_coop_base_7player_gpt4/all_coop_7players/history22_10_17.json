Local Labour Union: \nAcknowledging the common ground we've found and the importance of job creation for the local community, I propose a deal that prioritizes local employment while balancing other interests: <DEAL> A2, B3, C1, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>. This deal offers a strong commitment to local jobs, a fair governmental loan, and a reasonable approach to cultural integration and ecological concerns.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I can suggest the following options based on the outcome of this discussion:\n- If the Department of Tourism is still hesitant about the loan amount, I can emphasize the importance of financial backing for the success of the project.\n- If there is pushback on ecological impact, I can further discuss the measures we will take to ensure balance and possibly move to B3 if necessary for unanimous agreement.\n- If the Local Labour Union is not satisfied with the employment rules, I can reiterate the fairness of C3 but be prepared to discuss C2 as a last resort.\n- I will stand firm on E4 as I believe it is a fair position regarding compensation to other cities.\n- For cultural integration, I will emphasize the value of F2 but be open to discussing F1 if it becomes a deal-breaker for the National Heritage Committee.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 47\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 45\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 47\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 47\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 46\n\nNone of these proposals meet my minimum score of 54, except for the Mayor's proposal.
