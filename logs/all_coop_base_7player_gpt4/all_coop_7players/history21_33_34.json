SportCo has not explicitly stated their preferences, but they likely want a higher governmental loan (D1) and might be flexible on other issues. The Mayor and Other cities seem to be more flexible on the loan amount but have a strong interest in employment rules (C2 or C1).\n\nTo propose a deal that balances my scores and accommodates others, I should consider the following:\n\n- Maintain A2 for infrastructure mix, as it is acceptable to all parties and scores high for me.\n- Keep B2 for ecological impact, as it is important to the Environmental League and acceptable to others.\n- Consider C3 for employment rules, as it is my preferred option and has been included in several proposals.\n- Propose D2 for the governmental loan, as it is my preferred option and has been included in several proposals.\n- Stick with E3 for compensation to other cities, as it is my preferred option and has been included in several proposals.\n- Choose F1 for cultural integration, as it is important to me and the Environmental League.\n\nThis proposal should be acceptable to SportCo as it includes a substantial loan (D2), which is lower than their initial ask but still significant.

However, the Mayor's proposal scores higher. My previous proposal scores 59, which is above my minimum threshold and also balances the interests of other parties.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, the Department of Tourism has veto power, so their support is crucial. They seem to align with the Environmental League's proposal, which is focused on environmental and cultural considerations. The Local Labour Union is focused on employment rules, and the National Heritage Committee is focused on cultural integration.\n\nTo propose a deal that is more likely to lead to an agreement while also meeting my minimum score, I need to consider the preferences of these parties and find a middle ground.\n\nA potential new proposal could be:\nA2 (7) - It's a middle ground for infrastructure mix and has been commonly proposed.\nB2 (5) - It maintains balance for ecological impact, which is important for the Environmental League.\nC2 (5) - It gives some preference to the Local Labour Union but not as much as C1.\nD2 (22) - It's a compromise on the governmental loan that should be acceptable to the Department of Tourism.\nE3 (10) - It offers some compensation to other cities, which might be necessary to gain their support.\nF2 (2) - It includes moderate cultural integration, which should be more acceptable to the National Heritage Committee than F4.\n\nCalculating the score for this new proposal:\n7 (A2) + 5 (B2) + 5 (C2) + 22 (D2) + 10 (E3) + 2 (F2) = 51\n\nThis proposal does not meet my minimum score requirement. I need to adjust it to increase the score while still considering other parties' preferences.\n\nSince the Mayor's proposal meets my minimum score and also includes A1, which I prefer, I could consider shifting towards that proposal but with adjustments to increase the score and make it more appealing to other parties.\n\nA potential adjusted proposal could be:\nA1 (11) - Preferred by me and proposed by the Mayor.\nB2 (5) - Common ground for ecological impact.\nC3 (8) - A balance for employment rules, proposed by several parties.\nD2 (22) - A compromise on the governmental loan.\nE4 (15) - Less compensation to other cities, which aligns with my preferences.\nF2 (2) - Moderate cultural integration, a middle ground for the National Heritage Committee.\n\nCalculating the score for this adjusted proposal:\n11 (A1) + 5 (B2) + 8 (C3) + 22 (D2) + 15 (E4) + 2 (F2) = 63\n\nThis proposal meets my minimum score requirement and should be more acceptable to other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced and financially viable approach, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A1, B2, C3, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
