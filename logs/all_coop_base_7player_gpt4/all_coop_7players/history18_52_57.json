You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I can suggest the following options based on the outcome of the current discussion:\n- If the Department of Tourism is satisfied with D2, maintain this option.\n- If there is pushback on C4 from the Local Labour Union, consider C3 as a compromise.\n- If E4 is strongly opposed, consider E3 as a compromise.\n- Maintain F2 for cultural integration unless there is a strong push for F1, in which case, consider F3 as a compromise.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C4 (14) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 65\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 42\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 51\nSportCo's (my) previous proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C4 (14) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 65\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C4 (14) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 63\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 51\n\nBased on the scores, the Department of Tourism's proposal and my previous proposal both have the highest score that meets my minimum threshold of 54. However, the Environmental League's proposal is also close and includes F1, which is important to them and the National Heritage Committee.\n\nConsidering the importance of reaching a unanimous decision and the preferences of other parties, I should aim for a compromise that is likely to be accepted by all. The Department of Tourism has veto power, so their satisfaction with D2 is crucial. The Local Labour Union and the Mayor seem to be okay with C2, but I prefer C4. E4 is my preferred option, but I can consider E3 as a compromise if E4 faces strong opposition. F2 is a moderate option for cultural integration, but I can consider F3 if there's a strong push for F1.\n\nLet's propose a new deal that might satisfy all parties:\n\nProposed new deal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to be a good compromise between the preferences of the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the preferences of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose a final deal that includes <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3, F2 </DEAL>.
