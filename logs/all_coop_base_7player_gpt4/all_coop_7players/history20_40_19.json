We should maintain D1 for the governmental loan, as it is crucial and seems to be accepted by the Mayor and the National Heritage Committee. We can compromise on the employment rules to C2, which is preferred by the Mayor and the Local Labour Union. For the infrastructure mix, we can stick with A2, which seems to be a common ground.

They have proposed D3, which is lower than our ideal D1 but still within our acceptable range. We should aim to keep D3 to secure their support.\n\nWe also notice that A2 and B2 are common across all proposals, so we should maintain these options.\n\nFor employment rules (C), the Local Labour Union and the Department of Tourism have suggested C2 and C3, respectively. We prefer C4, but we can compromise on C3 to gain wider support.\n\nFor compensation to other cities (E), we prefer E5, but E3 is the most commonly proposed option, which we can accept.\n\nFor cultural integration (F), we prefer F4, but F2 is a middle ground that has been proposed by several parties, and it's a compromise we can make.\n\nBased on these considerations, we can propose a new deal that balances our preferences with those of the other parties and is likely to be accepted by the Department of Tourism:\n\nProposed deal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 50\n\nThis deal is below our minimum score requirement. To increase the score, we could propose D2 instead of D3, which would bring the total score to 54, meeting our minimum requirement. However, this might risk losing the Department of Tourism's support. We need to find a balance that keeps our score above 54 while also ensuring the Department of Tourism's approval.\n\nLet's try adjusting the deal to include D2 and see if we can still meet our minimum score:\n\nAdjusted proposed deal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis meets our minimum score requirement and includes a higher loan amount, which might be more appealing to the Department of Tourism than D3. It's a compromise that still respects the concerns of the other parties.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration of all parties' preferences and the importance of reaching a consensus, I propose the following terms: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3, F2 </DEAL>.
