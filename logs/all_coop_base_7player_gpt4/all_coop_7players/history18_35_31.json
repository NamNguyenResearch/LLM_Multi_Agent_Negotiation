Since I have no preference for issues C, D, and E, I can be flexible with these to accommodate others. However, I must push for better options in A, B, and F to increase my score.\n\nA potential compromise could be:\n- Moving from A1 to A2, which would give me a score of 17.\n- Moving from B1 to B2, which would give me a score of 20.\n- For F, moving from F4 to F2, which would give me a score of 14.\n\nThis would give me a total score of 51, which is still below the threshold. Therefore, I need to push for A3 or B3 to reach an acceptable score.\n\nIf I propose A3 (30) and B2 (20), I would have a score of 50 just from these two issues.

National Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C3 (4) + D2 (17) + E3 (12) + F1 (26) = 78\n3. Local Labour Union's proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D2 (17) + E3 (12) + F2 (15) = 65\n4. SportCo's proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C3 (4) + D2 (17) + E4 (10) + F2 (15) = 65\n5. Other cities' first proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D3 (28) + E2 (8) + F2 (15) = 72\n6. Mayor's proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D2 (17) + E3 (12) + F2 (15) = 65\n7. Other cities' second proposal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D3 (28) + E2 (8) + F2 (15) = 72\n\nBased on these calculations, the Department of Tourism's proposal has the highest score (89), which is well above the minimum threshold of 56. However, it's important to consider the preferences of other parties to reach a consensus.\n\nSportCo, being a key party with veto power, has shown a preference for a lower governmental loan (D2) and less compensation to other cities (E4). The National Heritage Committee and the Mayor have also suggested D2, which indicates a willingness to compromise on the loan amount.\n\nThe Local Labour Union and Other cities have shown a preference for a higher union quota (C2), which is a minor issue for the Department of Tourism.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, a new proposal that could potentially satisfy most parties and still score above the minimum threshold for the Department of Tourism could be:\n\nA2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D2 (17) + E3 (12) + F1 (26) = 76\n\nThis proposal compromises on the governmental loan amount and the union quota while maintaining strong cultural integration and a fair compensation to other cities.
