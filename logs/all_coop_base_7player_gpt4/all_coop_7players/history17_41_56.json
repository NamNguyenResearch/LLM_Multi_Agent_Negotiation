The Environmental League is our closest ally in terms of ecological and cultural concerns.\n\nTo propose a balanced deal, we might need to compromise on Issue A, as it's less critical than Issue F for us, and SportCo is very keen on A1. We could also potentially accept a lower option on Issue B, as long as it's not B1, to gain SportCo's favor. For Issue D, we want to maintain as high a governmental loan as possible to ensure funding for cultural projects.\n\nLet's propose a new deal that balances our interests with those of SportCo and other parties:\n\nProposed deal:\nIssue A: A2 (15) - A compromise between land and water that might be acceptable to SportCo.\nIssue B: B2 (12) - A step down from B3 but still maintains ecological balance.\nIssue D: D1 (17) - We aim to keep the highest funding possible.\nIssue F: F1 (40) - Our top priority, non-negotiable.\nIssue C: C3 (0) - We are indifferent to this issue.\nIssue E: E4 (0) - We are indifferent to this issue.\n\nTotal score for our proposed deal: 15 + 12 + 17 + 40 + 0 + 0 = 84\n\nThis proposal still meets our minimum score requirement and should be more palatable to SportCo while respecting the interests of other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a balanced compromise that respects our cultural heritage and the environment while considering SportCo's operational preferences and the local workforce.

If there's resistance to B2, we could explore additional environmental mitigation strategies to offset the impact. We should also be prepared to discuss the importance of cultural integration (F1) and why it's crucial for the project's success and community acceptance. We must remain firm on F1 as it's our top priority.

We need to find a compromise that will be acceptable to them while still meeting our minimum score of 50. The Department of Tourism's proposal is already aligned with our interests, so we should aim to keep the elements of F1 and a higher governmental loan (D2 or D1) in our proposal.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, we can see that A2 is a common ground for infrastructure mix, and B3 is favored by several parties for ecological impact. For employment rules, C1 and C3 are both mentioned, but since we have no preference here, we can be flexible. For the governmental loan, D2 and D3 are both acceptable to us, and we should aim for the higher amount if possible. Compensation to other cities is not our concern, but we should aim for a lower amount (E4 or E3) to make the deal more appealing to SportCo.\n\nTaking all this into account, let's propose a new deal that balances our interests with those of the other parties, especially SportCo and the Department of Tourism.\n\nProposed deal: A2 (15) + B3 (18) + C3 (0) + D2 (12) + E4 (0) + F1 (40) = 85\n\nThis deal meets our minimum score requirement and includes the top preferences for cultural integration and preservation, a balanced approach to ecological impact, and a substantial governmental loan, which may appeal to SportCo's interest in funding.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAcknowledging the importance of cultural heritage and environmental sustainability, and considering the financial aspects important to SportCo, I propose we consider <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL> as a balanced solution that aligns with our shared interests.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next round of negotiations, if there is resistance to the proposed deal, consider the following adjustments:\n- If SportCo insists on A1, we could potentially agree to it only if we can secure F1 and at least B2.\n- If there is resistance to D2, we could consider D3 but would need to ensure F1 is included.\n- Remain firm on F1, as it is our top priority, but show flexibility in other areas if needed to reach an agreement.\n- Continue to emphasize the importance of cultural heritage and its integration into the project.\n- Be prepared to discuss the importance of environmental sustainability and explore additional mitigation strategies if B3 is challenged.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nAcknowledging the importance of cultural heritage and environmental sustainability, and considering the financial aspects important to SportCo, I propose we consider <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL> as a balanced solution that aligns with our shared interests.\n"}, {"agent": "SportCo", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 7 interactions <HISTORY> .
