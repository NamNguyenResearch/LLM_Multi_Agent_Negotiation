However, the Department of Tourism's proposal is the closest to my minimum score. Since the Department of Tourism has veto power, their preferences are crucial. They seem to prefer a balanced approach with a moderate loan (D2), a mix of infrastructure (A2), and strong cultural integration (F1).\n\nConsidering the preferences of the other parties, it seems that a compromise on the infrastructure mix (A2) and ecological impact (B2) is likely to be accepted by most. The Local Labour Union is keen on having a union preference, so a compromise on employment rules (C3) might be necessary. The Department of Tourism's preference for a moderate loan (D2) is also important to consider.\n\nTo propose a new deal, I need to balance between my preferences and those of the other parties, while ensuring that the total score is above my minimum threshold of 54.\n\nLet's try a new combination that might be more acceptable to all parties:\n\nA2 (7) - A compromise on infrastructure mix that is acceptable to most parties.\nB2 (5) - A compromise on ecological impact that is acceptable to most parties.\nC3 (8) - A compromise on employment rules that gives some preference to the Local Labour Union.\nD2 (22) - A moderate loan that is preferred by the Department of Tourism.\nE4 (15) - A lower compensation to other cities, which is closer to my preference.\nF2 (2) - A moderate cultural integration that is a compromise between my preference and that of the Department of Tourism.\n\nCalculating the score for this new deal:\n7 (A2) + 5 (B2) + 8 (C3) + 22 (D2) + 15 (E4) + 2 (F2) = 59\n\nThis deal scores above my minimum threshold of 54 and seems to be a balanced compromise considering the preferences of the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.

They prefer E4 for compensation, which is lower than my preferred E3, but I can compromise on that if necessary.

This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nSportCo's last proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 56\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 57\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 52\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 57\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D1 (30) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\n\nBased on these calculations, the proposals from the Local Labour Union, National Heritage Committee, Environmental League, and Mayor all meet or exceed SportCo's minimum score requirement of 54. However, the Department of Tourism and Other cities' proposals do not meet this threshold.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism has veto power, it is crucial to ensure their proposal meets the minimum score requirement. Since their proposal is only 2 points away from the minimum, adjusting either the compensation to other cities (E3 to E4) or cultural integration (F1 to F2) would suffice.\n\nGiven the importance of the governmental loan (D2) and the need to accommodate the Department of Tourism, I will maintain D2 in my final proposal. I will also maintain A2, as it seems to be a common choice among all parties.\n\nFor employment rules (C), I notice that the Local Labour Union prefers C2, but C3 is more favorable to SportCo and is also acceptable to other parties. I will propose C3.\n\nFor ecological impact (B), B2 is the common ground among all parties, so I will keep B2.\n\nFor compensation to other cities (E), I will propose E4, as it is acceptable to most parties and aligns with SportCo's interests.\n\nFor cultural integration (F), I will propose F2, as it is a compromise between SportCo's preference and the desires of the National Heritage Committee and the Environmental League.\n\nFinal proposal calculation: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests and our shared goal of reaching a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
