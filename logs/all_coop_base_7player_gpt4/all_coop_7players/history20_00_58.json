The Local Labour Union prefers a stronger position for local employment, so C2 might be a necessary compromise. The Environmental League and National Heritage Committee are focused on cultural and environmental issues, so moving towards F1 could help gain their support.\n\nI need to increase the score of the current consensus proposal to meet my minimum score requirement.
