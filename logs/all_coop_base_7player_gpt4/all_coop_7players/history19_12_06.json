SportCo's initial proposal is not acceptable to me due to its low score and environmental impact.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties and my own, I need to propose a deal that is likely to be acceptable to SportCo while also meeting my minimum score requirement. I will propose a deal that includes a lower governmental loan, as this is important to me, and a strong cultural integration, which is also a priority. I will also consider the environmental impact and infrastructure mix that are important to other parties.\n\nProposed deal:\n- Infrastructure Mix: A2 (9) - This is acceptable to most parties and aligns with my preference.\n- Ecological Impact: B2 (10) - This is a middle ground that should satisfy environmental concerns.\n- Employment Rules: C2 (2) - This gives some preference to the local labor union but not as much as C1.\n- Governmental Loan: D3 (28) - This is my preferred option as it involves the least amount of loan.\n- Compensation to Other Cities: E3 (12) - This aligns with my assessment of a fair compensation.\n- Cultural Integration and Preservation: F1 (26) - This is important for tourism and cultural heritage.\n\nCalculating the score for the proposed deal: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D3 (28) + E3 (12) + F1 (26) = 87\n\nThis deal has a score of 87, which is well above my minimum threshold and should be appealing to other parties as well.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI propose a balanced deal that addresses our shared interests in environmental protection, cultural integration, and reasonable financial investment.
