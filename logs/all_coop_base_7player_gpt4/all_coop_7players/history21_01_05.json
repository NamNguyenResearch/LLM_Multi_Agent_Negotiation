Our preferred option is E3.\n\nConsidering all this, we should propose a deal that includes our preferred options while making concessions that are likely to be accepted by other parties, especially SportCo.\n\nLet's propose a deal that includes:\n- A2, which is consistently chosen by all parties.\n- B2, which is also consistently chosen and aligns with our environmental concerns.\n- C2, as a compromise on employment rules.\n- D3, our most preferred option for the governmental loan, which has been proposed by others as well.\n- E3, our preferred compensation to other cities, which has been proposed by others.\n- F2, a moderate cultural integration that we and others have proposed.\n\nThis deal would score: A2 (9) + B2 (10) + C2 (2) + D3 (28) + E3 (12) + F2 (15) = 76, which is above our minimum threshold.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the preferences of all parties and aiming for a balanced solution, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E3, F2 </DEAL>.

Local Labour Union: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' preferences and our own, I propose we finalize with a balanced deal that supports local employment, ecological preservation, and cultural integration: <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL>. This proposal aligns with our shared goals and is a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I can suggest:\n- Maintaining the governmental loan at D2, as it seems acceptable to most parties and aligns with the Department of Tourism's preference.\n- Keeping the employment quota at C2, which has been consistently included in most proposals.\n- Pushing for E4 to increase our score while still offering a compromise to Other cities.\n- Compromising on cultural integration by accepting F1, which is important to the Department of Tourism and the National Heritage Committee.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nMy previous proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 54\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F3 (8) = 52\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 54\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 47\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 49\n\nBased on these calculations, the proposals that meet my minimum score of 54 are my previous proposal and the National Heritage Committee's proposal. However, the Environmental League and Other cities have proposed options that are less favorable to SportCo, and their preferences need to be considered to reach a unanimous decision.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's veto power and the importance of cultural integration for the National Heritage Committee, it seems wise to maintain F1. The Local Labour Union and the Mayor have shown a preference for C2, which is also acceptable to SportCo. The Department of Tourism and Other cities have shown flexibility on the governmental loan, so D2 is a good middle ground.\n\nTo increase the chances of reaching a unanimous decision, I will need to make a concession on the compensation to other cities. E3 seems to be the most commonly accepted option among the other parties, and it is a compromise I am willing to make.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the following deal:\n\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\n\nThis deal does not meet my minimum score of 54, so I will need to adjust one of the options to increase the score. Since A2 is the most commonly accepted option for infrastructure mix and B2 is a middle ground for ecological impact, I will suggest changing E3 to E4, which is still a compromise but increases the score to meet the minimum threshold.\n\nNew proposed deal:\n\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 54\n\nThis deal meets my minimum score and seems to be a balanced compromise that takes into account the preferences of the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests and our shared goals, I propose the following balanced deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL>.
