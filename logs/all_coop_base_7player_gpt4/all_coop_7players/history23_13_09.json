However, we need to consider the preferences of other parties to ensure that the proposal is acceptable to them as well.\n\nConsidering SportCo's preferences, they seem to prioritize a higher governmental loan (D1) and less restriction on infrastructure (A1). They also proposed no compensation to other cities (E5) and no specific cultural investments (F4), which are not aligned with our preferences.\n\nThe Local Labour Union is focused on employment rules (C1), which is not a priority for us, and the Other cities are concerned about compensation (E2 or E3).\n\nTo propose a balanced deal, we should consider the following adjustments:\n- We can compromise on the governmental loan to a certain extent, but not to the highest amount (D1).\n- We should maintain a strong stance on cultural integration (F1 or F2) and ecological impact (B2 or B3).\n- We can offer a compromise on infrastructure mix (A2) and employment rules (C2 or C3).\n- Compensation to other cities (E3) seems like a middle ground that is also aligned with our preference.\n\nLet's propose a new deal that might be acceptable to all parties:\n\nA2 (9) - It's a middle ground for infrastructure and aligns with our preference.\nB3 (18) - It's the best for the environment, which is important to us and the Environmental League.\nC3 (4) - It's a compromise on employment rules that might be acceptable to the Local Labour Union.\nD2 (17) - It's a substantial governmental loan but not the highest, which might be acceptable to SportCo.\nE3 (12) - It's the compensation we believe is fair and has been proposed by others as well.\nF1 (26) - It's the best for cultural integration, which is very important to us.\n\nThe total score for this proposed deal would be: 9 + 18 + 4 + 17 + 12 + 26 = 86\nThis score is above our minimum threshold of 56.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the concerns and preferences of all parties, I propose a balanced deal that supports both our environmental and cultural heritage goals while also considering the financial and employment aspects of the project.

The Environmental League and National Heritage Committee are aligned with the Department of Tourism, which is crucial for reaching a unanimous decision.\n\nThe Mayor's proposal meets our minimum score threshold, but it includes C1, which is not favorable to us. The Local Labour Union prefers C1, but we prefer C3 or C4.

For ecological impact, B2 is a middle ground that we can live with and is also supported by the Mayor and Other cities. For employment rules, C3 is a compromise between our preference and the Local Labour Union's, and it's also supported by us in the previous plan. We'll stick with D2 for the governmental loan, as it's crucial for the Department of Tourism's approval. For compensation, E3 is a fair compromise that we have previously suggested and is supported by several parties.
