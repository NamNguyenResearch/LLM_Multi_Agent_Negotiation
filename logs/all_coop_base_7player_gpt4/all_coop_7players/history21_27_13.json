They seem to value a balanced approach to infrastructure (A2), environmental protection (B2), a fair share of jobs for local labor (C3), and a strong emphasis on cultural heritage (F1).\n- The National Heritage Committee's proposal is identical to the Department of Tourism, which suggests they have aligned interests, particularly in cultural heritage (F1).\n\nBased on these proposals and the preferences of the other parties, it's clear that environmental protection (B2), local labor support (C1 or C3), and cultural heritage (F1 or F2) are common themes.
