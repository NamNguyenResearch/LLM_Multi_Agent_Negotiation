The Department of Tourism has shown a preference for a balanced approach, including a moderate governmental loan (D2) and compensation to other cities (E3). The Mayor and the National Heritage Committee have shown a strong preference for cultural integration (F1 and F2).\n\nTo propose a deal that balances my preferences with those of the other parties, I need to consider the following:\n- SportCo is likely to push back on A3, so A2 might be a more acceptable compromise.\n- B3 is non-negotiable for me due to its high score and importance.\n- C3 seems to be a common ground for employment rules.\n- D1 or D2 could be acceptable for the Department of Tourism, but D1 is preferred by SportCo.\n- E3 is a middle ground for compensation to other cities.\n- F1 is my preferred option for cultural integration, but F2 is also acceptable and might be more palatable to SportCo.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will propose a deal that includes A2, B3, C3, D1, E3, and F1, which would give me a score of 87 and also seems to align with the preferences of the other parties to some extent.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAcknowledging the importance of environmental protection and cultural heritage, and considering the financial aspects important to SportCo and the Department of Tourism, I propose a balanced deal: <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D1, E3, F1 </DEAL>.
