The Department of Tourism's proposal already meets my minimum score, so I should be open to accepting it. However, I could suggest a slight modification to increase the score slightly and make it more appealing to other parties, such as the Local Labour Union and the National Heritage Committee, who have shown a preference for C2 and F1, respectively.\n\nI will propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D2, E3, and F1. This should be acceptable to the Department of Tourism and also increase the score for the National Heritage Committee and the Local Labour Union, potentially leading to a unanimous agreement.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this proposed deal:\nA2 (7), B2 (5), C2 (5), D2 (22), E3 (10), F1 (0) = 49\n\nThis score is below my minimum threshold. To increase the score, I could consider adjusting the compensation to other cities to E4, which would still be within a reasonable range for them and increase my score.\n\nNew proposed deal calculation:\nA2 (7), B2 (5), C2 (5), D2 (22), E4 (15), F1 (0) = 54\n\nThis meets my minimum score requirement and is likely to be more appealing to other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter considering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced solution, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL>.
