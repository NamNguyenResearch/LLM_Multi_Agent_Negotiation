SportCo prefers A1, B1, and likely D1 for maximum funding, while the Department of Tourism's preferences are not explicitly known but they would likely favor options that promote tourism and economic growth.\n\nGiven that I have no preference for issues C and E, I can use these as leverage in negotiations. My main goal is to push for F1, which is non-negotiable for me, and I prefer A3 and B3 to protect the cultural and natural heritage of the region.
