However, I can see that the Department of Tourism, which has veto power, is comfortable with D2, so I will not push for D1.\n\nFor the compensation to other cities (E), I prefer E4 or E5, but I see a trend towards E3 in the proposals. I could potentially accept E3 if other more favorable terms are met.\n\nCultural integration (F) is not a priority for me, and I prefer F4, but I see that F1 and F2 are more popular among other parties. I could accept F2 as a compromise.\n\nFor employment rules (C), I prefer C4, but C3 is the most popular among other parties, and I can accept that.\n\nFor infrastructure mix (A), I prefer A1, but A2 is the common ground, and I am willing to accept that.\n\nFor ecological impact (B), I prefer B1, but B2 is the common choice, and I can accept that as well.\n\nNow, let's try to find a proposal that would be above my minimum score and potentially acceptable to others:\n\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 59\n\nThis proposal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to be a reasonable compromise based on the previous interactions.
