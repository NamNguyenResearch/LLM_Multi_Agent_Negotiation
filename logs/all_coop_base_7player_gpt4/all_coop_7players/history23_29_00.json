However, I need to consider the preferences of other parties to ensure the deal is also acceptable to them and to aim for unanimity.\n\nBased on the history of interactions, it seems that:\n- The Environmental League is pushing for B3, which is a high priority for them.\n- The Local Labour Union seems to be okay with C2.\n- The Department of Tourism has suggested D2, which aligns with my preference.\n- Other cities have suggested E3, which is a compromise I can consider.\n- The National Heritage Committee is pushing for F1, which is important for them.\n\nConsidering these preferences and the need to reach a unanimous decision, I can adjust my proposal to accommodate these concerns while still maintaining a score above my minimum threshold.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a new proposed deal that takes into account the preferences of other parties:\nA2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\n\nThis score is below my minimum threshold. Therefore, I need to adjust the deal to increase the score while still considering other parties' preferences. Since D2 is crucial for the financial viability of the project and aligns with the Department of Tourism's preference, I must maintain it. I can compromise on E3 instead of E4 to increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement.\n\nLet's calculate the score for a deal with E3 instead of E4:\nA2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 46\n\nThis is still below my minimum threshold. I need to find another area to compromise. Since F1 is important for the National Heritage Committee, I can consider F1 if it's a deal-breaker for them. However, I need to maintain or improve other areas to keep my score above the minimum.\n\nIf I switch back to E4 and maintain F1, the new score would be:\nA2 (7) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 49\n\nThis is still below my minimum threshold. I need to improve the score in another area. Since B3 is non-negotiable for the Environmental League, I can consider moving from C2 to C3, which is a smaller compromise for me.\n\nLet's calculate the score with C3 instead of C2:\nA2 (7) + B3 (0) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 52\n\nThis is still below my minimum threshold. The only remaining option is to move from B3 to B2, which is a compromise but still within environmental regulations.\n\nLet's calculate the score with B2 instead of B3:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F1 (0) = 57\n\nThis score is above my minimum threshold and takes into account the preferences of other parties. It's a compromise I am willing to make to reach an agreement.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced solution, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL>.
