It also includes a strong cultural integration component, which I value highly. The employment rules and compensation to other cities are not my concern, so I have flexibility there. I chose a lower governmental loan amount to make the deal more appealing to the Department of Tourism, which may be concerned about budget constraints.\n\nNow, let's consider the other parties:\n\n- SportCo likely wants A1 and B1, but they may be willing to compromise on A2 and B2 if it means the project can go ahead.\n- The Local Labour Union has already shown flexibility on infrastructure and ecological impact, and they are interested in a union quota.\n- The Department of Tourism might prefer a lower loan amount to reduce financial risk.\n- The Mayor and the Regional Heritage Committee will likely be interested in cultural integration, so F1 should appeal to them.\n\nBy proposing A3, B2, and F1, I am aligning with the broader interests of environmental protection and cultural preservation, which could be key to gaining support from the Mayor and the Regional Heritage Committee.

However, we need to consider the preferences of SportCo and the Department of Tourism, as they have veto power.\n\nGiven that SportCo prefers A1 and B1, which we score very low, we need to find a compromise on A and B. A2 and B2 seem to be acceptable middle grounds that have been consistently proposed by other parties.\n\nFor the employment rules (C), we are indifferent, so we can be flexible here. However, we should note that the Local Labour Union has a strong preference for C1, which might be a sticking point for them.\n\nRegarding the governmental loan (D), we prefer the highest amount possible, as it increases the likelihood of funding for cultural projects. D2 seems to be the most commonly accepted option among the parties.\n\nFor compensation to other cities (E), we are indifferent, but we should be mindful of the preferences of other parties to facilitate agreement.\n\nBased on these considerations, we should propose a deal that includes F1 for cultural integration, which is our top priority, and balances other issues to accommodate the preferences of SportCo and the Department of Tourism.\n\nLet's propose a deal that includes F1 and aims for a compromise on other issues:\n\nProposed deal: A2, B2, C3, D2, E4, F1\nThis deal scores: A2 (15) + B2 (12) + C3 (0) + D2 (12) + E4 (0) + F1 (40) = 79\n\nThis deal meets our minimum score requirement and includes our top priority of comprehensive cultural integration (F1).
