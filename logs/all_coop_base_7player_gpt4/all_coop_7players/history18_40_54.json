However, I need to consider the preferences of other parties to reach an agreement.\n\nThe Department of Tourism has veto power, so their preferences are crucial. They seem to prefer a balanced approach with a reasonable loan (D2) and are likely to support ecological balance (B2) and cultural integration (F1).\n\nThe Local Labour Union is focused on employment (C1), but I cannot accept that as it would lower my score below the threshold. I need to find a middle ground that is more favorable than C1 but still acceptable to them.\n\nOther cities are concerned about compensation (E2), but I prefer not to increase compensation as it would lower my score. I need to maintain at least E3 to stay above my threshold.\n\nConsidering these factors, I need to propose a deal that is as close to my previous proposal as possible while making slight adjustments to accommodate other parties' preferences.\n\nPotential new proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 51\n\nThis proposal is below my threshold, so I need to adjust it further. If I can convince the Department of Tourism to accept F2 instead of F1, that would bring my score to 53, which is still below my threshold. I need to maintain F2 and find another area to compromise.\n\nIf I adjust the employment distribution to C2, which the Mayor and National Heritage Committee seem to support, and keep the rest of my previous proposal, the new score would be:\n\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 51\n\nThis is still below my threshold. I need to maintain C3 to stay above the threshold. I could propose increasing compensation to E2 to gain support from other cities, but that would lower my score too much.\n\nI need to maintain at least E3. The only option I have to increase my score without going below the threshold is to convince the Department of Tourism to accept F2. If they agree to F2, my score would be:\n\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\n\nThis is my minimum acceptable score.
