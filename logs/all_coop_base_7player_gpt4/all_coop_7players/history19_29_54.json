They seem to prefer a lower governmental loan (D3) and a strong emphasis on cultural integration (F1). However, D3 is less preferable for us, and F1 is the least preferable. We need to find a middle ground.\n\nThe Mayor's proposal has the highest score for us (65), but it includes C1, which we scored 0, and D1, which might not be acceptable to the Department of Tourism.

We need to adjust the proposal to increase the score while still considering other parties' preferences. Since the Department of Tourism prefers a lower loan, we might need to compromise on D3, but we can try to push for E4 to increase our score and maintain a higher preference for F2.\n\nAdjusted proposed deal:\n- A2: Same as above.\n- B2: Same as above.\n- C2: Same as above.\n- D3: Lower loan amount to accommodate the Department of Tourism.\n- E4: Higher compensation to other cities to increase our score.\n- F2: Maintain moderate cultural integration.\n\nLet's calculate the score for the adjusted proposed deal:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 52\n\nThis score is still below our minimum threshold. We need to adjust further.

This proposal offers a fair compromise on infrastructure, ecological impact, employment, loan amount, compensation, and cultural integration, with a strong emphasis on preserving our regional heritage.\n \n . Mayor: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests and the need for a balanced solution, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C1, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>. This proposal takes into account the importance of local employment, a reasonable governmental loan, and cultural integration, while also addressing ecological concerns and offering a fair compensation to other cities.\n \n . Other cities: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests, I propose a balanced deal that supports local employment, fair compensation, and cultural integration, while also being mindful of the financial implications for future projects. I suggest we move forward with the following deal: <DEAL> A2, C1, D3, E2, F2 </DEAL>.\n \n . Environmental League: \nAfter careful consideration of all parties' interests and the need to protect our environment, I propose the following balanced deal: <DEAL> A3, B2, C1, D3, E3, F2 </DEAL>. This proposal emphasizes environmental protection and cultural integration while respecting the interests of the local labour and heritage communities.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I can suggest the following options based on the outcome of this discussion:\n- If the Department of Tourism is still hesitant about the loan amount, I can suggest keeping D3.\n- If there is pushback on compensation to other cities, I can consider moving from E4 to E3.\n- If cultural integration is a sticking point, I can maintain F3 or consider moving to F2 if necessary for unanimous approval.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the deals proposed by each party:\n\nSportCo's initial proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E4 (15) + F3 (8) = 58\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 51\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 45\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 51\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + C1 (0) + D3 (18) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 32 (missing B option)\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A3 (0) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D3 (18) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 35\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's veto power and the need for their approval, we should aim for a deal that includes D3. The Department of Tourism also prefers F1, but that has a score of 0 for us, which is not acceptable. We need to find a middle ground on F.\n\nThe Local Labour Union and the Mayor both prefer C1, but that has a score of 0 for us. We need to push for at least C2.\n\nThe Environmental League prefers A3, but that has a score of 0 for us. We need to push for at least A2.\n\nBased on the above, let's try to find a compromise that would be acceptable to all parties and still meet our minimum score requirement of 54.\n\nPotential compromise proposal:\nA2 (7) - It's a middle ground for infrastructure.\nB2 (5) - It's a common option that most parties agree on.\nC2 (5) - It's a compromise on employment, better than C1.\nD3 (18) - It's the preferred option by the Department of Tourism.\nE3 (10) - It's a compromise on compensation, and many parties have suggested it.\nF2 (2) - It's a compromise on cultural integration, better than F1 for us.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this compromise proposal:\n7 (A2) + 5 (B2) + 5 (C2) + 18 (D3) + 10 (E3) + 2 (F2) = 47\n\nThis proposal does not meet our minimum score requirement. We need to adjust it to increase the score while still considering other parties' preferences.\n\nIf we adjust E from E3 to E4, we get an additional 5 points, which would bring the total score to 52, still below our minimum.\n\nIf we adjust F from F2 to F3, we get an additional 6 points, which would bring the total score to 53, still below our minimum.\n\nWe need to adjust both E and F to meet our minimum score requirement.\n\nFinal compromise proposal:\nA2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D3 (18) + E4 (15) + F3 (8) = 58\n\nThis meets our minimum score requirement and seems to be a reasonable compromise based on other parties' proposals and preferences.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration and aiming to accommodate the interests of all parties, I propose the following final deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E4, F3 </DEAL>.
