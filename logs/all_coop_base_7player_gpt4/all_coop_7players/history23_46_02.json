We can compromise on the infrastructure mix (A2) and ecological impact (B2) to accommodate the Environmental League and the National Heritage Committee. For employment rules, we can aim for a middle ground (C3) to appease the Local Labour Union.

However, we need to consider the preferences of other parties to reach a consensus.\n\nGiven that SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power, we need to ensure that the deal is attractive to them. SportCo has shown a preference for A2 and B2, which align with our acceptable options. The Department of Tourism's preferences are not explicitly stated, but they would likely prefer a higher governmental loan to ensure the project's success.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, we can propose a deal that includes A2, which seems to be a common ground for infrastructure mix, and B3, which is the most environmentally friendly option and has been included in several proposals. For the employment rules, we can stick with C3, as it doesn't affect our score and seems to be a middle ground. For the governmental loan, we can propose D2, which is a compromise between the highest and lowest options and has been included in several proposals. For compensation to other cities, we can propose E4, as it doesn't affect our score and has been included in several proposals. Finally, for cultural integration, we must insist on F1, as it is our top priority.\n\nLet's propose a deal that balances our preferences with those of other parties and is likely to be accepted by SportCo and the Department of Tourism.\n\nProposed deal: A2 (15), B3 (18), C3 (0), D2 (12), E4 (0), F1 (40)\nTotal score = 15 + 18 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 40 = 85\n\nThis deal exceeds our minimum threshold and respects the preferences of other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the collective interests and the importance of cultural heritage, I propose a balanced deal: <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D2, E4, F1 </DEAL>.
