We need to adjust the proposal to meet our minimum score while also considering the interests of the other parties.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism has veto power, we need to ensure that the governmental loan (Issue D) is appealing to them.

However, C1 is not acceptable to us, so we should aim for at least C3.\n\nThe Environmental League is likely to be concerned with ecological impact (Issue B) and infrastructure mix (Issue A). We might need to compromise on B2 to maintain balance for the local dolphin and sea lion populations.\n\nThe Regional Heritage Committee will care about cultural integration and preservation (Issue F). We prefer F4, but we might need to consider F3 to gain their support.\n\n\"Other cities\" will want compensation (Issue E), but we prefer not to pay.
