However, we need to find common ground with the other parties. It seems that A2, B3, C2, D2, and E3 are recurring in most proposals, which indicates a general preference for these options among the other parties. The main contention is with F, where we need F1, but others are suggesting F2 and F3.\n\nConsidering the importance of F1 to us, we could potentially agree to A2 if it helps us secure F1. We could also consider D1 if it increases the likelihood of funding for cultural projects, as per our previous plan. Since we don't care about E, we can use it as a bargaining chip.\n\nLet's propose a deal that includes A2, which seems acceptable to most, B3 to satisfy the Environmental League, C2 for the Local Labour Union, D1 for increased funding, E3 as a middle ground for compensation, and F1, which is non-negotiable for us.\n\nProposed deal calculation: A2 (15) + B3 (18) + C2 (0) + D1 (17) + E3 (0) + F1 (40) = 90\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAcknowledging the preferences of all parties and the need for a balanced outcome, I propose we consider <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D1, E3, F1 </DEAL>.
