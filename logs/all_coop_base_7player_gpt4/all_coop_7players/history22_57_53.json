This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 46\nMayor's proposal: A1 (11) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 50\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 44\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 46\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\n\nNone of these proposals meet my minimum score of 54.
