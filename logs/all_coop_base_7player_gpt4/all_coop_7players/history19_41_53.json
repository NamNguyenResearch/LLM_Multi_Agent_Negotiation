They have proposed D3 in their deal, which is not ideal for us, but we might need to accept it to secure their support.\n- The Local Labour Union prefers C1, but this has a score of 0 for us. We need to move this towards C2 or C3 to increase our score.\n- The Environmental League and the National Heritage Committee seem to be aligned on B2 and F1, but F1 has a score of 0 for us. We could propose F2 to increase our score slightly while still showing consideration for cultural integration.\n- The Mayor has shown support for a strong governmental loan (D1), which aligns with our interests. We could propose D1 to increase our score and potentially gain the Mayor's support.\n- For the compensation to other cities (Issue E), we prefer E5, but we might need to compromise. E4 has been mentioned by the Mayor and would be a better option for us than E3.\n\nConsidering these points, let's propose a deal that might be more acceptable to us and still consider the preferences of the other parties:\n\nProposed deal: A2 (7), B2 (5), C2 (5), D1 (30), E4 (15), F2 (2).
