However, we need to consider SportCo's preferences as they have veto power. SportCo seems to prefer A2 over A3, and they want the highest governmental loan (D1). They also prefer minimal cultural integration (F3 or F4), which is against our interests.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties and the need to reach a deal that is acceptable to SportCo and the Department of Tourism, I will propose a deal that includes the highest governmental loan (which SportCo wants), a land-based infrastructure mix (which is important to us and the Environmental League), and a high level of cultural integration (our top priority). I will also include a moderate ecological impact option to appeal to the Environmental League and a union quota to appeal to the Local Labour Union.\n\nLet's propose a deal that balances these interests:\n\nA3 (25) - We prefer land-based to protect historical sites.\nB2 (12) - We value the natural landscape and this will appeal to the Environmental League.\nC2 (0) - We don't care about this, but it will appeal to the Local Labour Union.\nD1 (17) - SportCo wants the highest loan, and it benefits us as well.\nE3 (0) - We don't care about this, but it's a middle ground for compensation to other cities.\nF1 (40) - Our top priority is comprehensive cultural integration.\n\nCalculating the score for our proposal:\nA3 (25) + B2 (12) + C2 (0) + D1 (17) + E3 (0) + F1 (40) = 94\n\nThis proposal has a score of 94, which is well above our minimum threshold of 50.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A3, B2, C2, D1, E3, F1 </DEAL>.
