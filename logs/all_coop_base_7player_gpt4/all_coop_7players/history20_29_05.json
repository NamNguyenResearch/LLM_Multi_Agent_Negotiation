This proposal should meet the interests of all parties and ensure the success of the Harbour Sport Park.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIn the final voting session, I can suggest the following options based on the outcome of this final discussion session:\n\n- If the Department of Tourism insists on a higher ecological standard, I could consider shifting from B2 to B3, but only if I can adjust other options to maintain my minimum score.\n- If the Local Labour Union strongly opposes C3, I could consider C2 as a compromise, again ensuring my minimum score is met.\n- If the National Heritage Committee insists on F1, I could negotiate on other less critical issues to accommodate this preference while keeping my score above 54.\n- I will remain firm on D2 as it is crucial for the Department of Tourism's approval and my own financial interests.\n- I will also remain firm on E3 as a reasonable compensation to other cities.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\nThis proposal is below my minimum acceptable score of 54.\n\nMy previous proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\nThis proposal meets my minimum acceptable score.\n\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E2 (5) + F2 (2) = 36\nThis proposal is well below my minimum acceptable score.\n\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 41\nThis proposal is also below my minimum acceptable score.\n\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C1 (0) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 46\nThis proposal is below my minimum acceptable score.\n\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F2 (2) = 54\nThis proposal meets my minimum acceptable score and is crucial since they have veto power.\n\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\nThis proposal is below my minimum acceptable score.\n\nBased on these calculations, the proposals from the Department of Tourism and my previous proposal are the only ones that meet my minimum score requirement.
