However, it's important to consider the preferences of other parties to reach a consensus.\n\nSportCo, having veto power, is crucial to the agreement. They have proposed D1 in both their deals, which indicates a strong preference for the highest governmental loan. However, this is not ideal for me. They also seem to prefer no compensation to other cities (E5) and are flexible with cultural integration, proposing F1 in one deal and F2 in another.\n\nThe Environmental League and National Heritage Committee both prioritize environmental and cultural aspects (B2 and F1), which align with my preferences.\n\nThe Local Labour Union has not spoken, but based on the proposals, there seems to be a leaning towards C2 or C3, which I can be flexible with.\n\nConsidering all this, I need to propose a deal that is acceptable to SportCo but also does not compromise my minimum score too much. I will propose a deal that includes D2, which is the highest score for me in the governmental loan category and still offers substantial financial support. I will also maintain F1 for cultural integration, which is important for me and aligns with other parties' preferences.
