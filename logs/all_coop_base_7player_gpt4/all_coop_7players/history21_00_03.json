This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the scores for the most recent proposals from each party:\n\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 49\nNational Heritage Committee's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E5 (20) + F1 (0) = 62\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 52\nSportCo's (My) proposal: A2 (7) + B1 (9) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 63\nOther cities' proposal: A2 (7) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E3 (10) + F1 (0) = 47 (missing B option)\nMayor's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C2 (5) + D1 (30) + E5 (20) + F2 (2) = 69\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2 (7) + B2 (5) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E5 (20) + F1 (0) = 62\n\nBased on these calculations, the proposals from the National Heritage Committee, SportCo, Mayor, and Environmental League meet my minimum score requirement of 54. However, the Mayor's proposal includes the highest governmental loan (D1), which is not likely to be accepted by the Department of Tourism, who has veto power.\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism's preferences and the need for their approval, I should avoid suggesting the highest loan (D1). The National Heritage Committee and Environmental League's proposals include comprehensive cultural integration (F1), which is not my preference, and it's also a costly option.\n\nMy previous plan was to suggest A2, B1, C3, D2, E4, F2. This proposal had a score of 63, which is above my minimum threshold. However, to increase the likelihood of reaching a unanimous agreement and to accommodate the preferences of other parties, I may need to adjust my proposal slightly.\n\nI will maintain A2 for infrastructure mix and D2 for the governmental loan, as these are commonly accepted and crucial for the project. For ecological impact, I will stick with B1, emphasizing compliance with guidelines. For employment rules, C3 seems to be a middle ground that is acceptable to most. For compensation to other cities, I will propose E4 as a compromise. For cultural integration, I will offer F2, which is a moderate approach.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this adjusted proposal:\nAdjusted proposal: A2 (7) + B1 (9) + C3 (8) + D2 (22) + E4 (15) + F2 (2) = 63\n\nThis proposal still meets my minimum score requirement and is likely to be more acceptable to other parties than my previous proposal.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration of everyone's preferences and aiming for a balanced agreement that meets our common interests, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B1, C3, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
