The Mayor, Other cities, and the Local Labour Union are flexible on the employment issue, but they lean towards C1, which is also not ideal for me. The National Heritage Committee insists on F1, which I cannot accept.\n\nConsidering the preferences of other parties, I need to find a middle ground that is acceptable to all and still meets my minimum score. I will propose a deal that includes A2, which seems to be commonly accepted, and D2, which is crucial for the Department of Tourism. I will also include E4, which is acceptable to most parties and gives me a higher score. For the employment issue, I will propose C2, which is a compromise between C1 and C3. For the ecological impact, I will stick with B2, which is commonly accepted. Finally, I will propose F2 for cultural integration, which is a compromise between F1 and F3.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this new proposal:\nA2 (7), B2 (5), C2 (5), D2 (22), E4 (15), F2 (2)\nTotal score = 7 + 5 + 5 + 22 + 15 + 2 = 56\n\nThis proposal meets my minimum score requirement and seems to be a good compromise based on the preferences of other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties and aiming for a balanced agreement, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4, F2 </DEAL>.
