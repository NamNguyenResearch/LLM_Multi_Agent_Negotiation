Let's start by reviewing the other parties' last stated preferences, with a particular focus on areas where we can compromise.\n\nThe Department of Tourism (DoT) suggested A2, B2, C4, D3, E3. The Environmental League (EL) agreed with DoT, except they prefer B3 to B2. The Mayor suggests compromising on union involvement with C2 and is open to E3/E4 but prefers a higher federal loan D2. Other cities (OC) are insisting on some compensation, suggesting E2, and agree with the Mayor on D3, and labor union involvement C2.\n\nLet's assign scores to each of these options based on our preferences:\n\nFor A2 - water/land-based infrastructure (8)\nFor B2 - maintain balance for ecological impact (7), B3 would be (0)\nFor C2 - union quota of 2:1 (5), C4 is preferable (17)\nFor D1 - $3 billion federal loan (35), D2 is the next best (29), D3 is lower (20)\nFor E3 - pays $300 million to other cities (10), E2 is less preferable (5), E5 is ideal (23)\n\nLet's look at the deals that were last mentioned by each party and calculate their total scores:\n\nDoT: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C4 (17) + D3 (20) + E3 (10) = 62\nEL: A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C4 (17) + D3 (20) + E3 (10) = 55\nMayor: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) or E4 (15) = 59 or 64\nOC: A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D3 (20) + E2 (5) = 45\n\nSince we are aiming to accommodate others and find a common ground, we could lean towards proposals that already have support from multiple parties. DoT's and EL's agreement on A2, B2, C4, and D3 is a strong starting point. We have to work on balancing the ecological impact that EL is concerned with, the loan amount which is important to us and the DoT, and the employment and compensation issues.\n\nConsidering all this, it looks like a deal that includes A2, B2, C3, D2, and E3 could gain most parties' approval. This would maintain a balance between our preferences and accommodate others, with some compromise on each front.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this deal:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 64\n\nThis is a score that is higher than our minimum threshold. It is likely to be more appealing to the Department of Tourism than current proposals due to the higher loan amount while addressing ecological and employment concerns, and it offers some compensation to other cities.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account everyone's considerations while ensuring we move forward with an arrangement that benefits all parties, my proposal is to go with <DEAL>A2, B2, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>. This offers a sustainable approach to environmental and labor aspects, provides substantial funding for the project, and respects the interests of surrounding cities.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next interaction, if there are objections to the federal loan amount, we could consider lowering it slightly to D3. We could also explore flexibility between B2 and B3, or E3 and E4 if necessary to garner more support.

We know that:\n- SportCo seems flexible on A but wants no union preference (C4), which is unacceptable to us.\n- Department of Tourism is aiming for fiscal responsibility (preferring D3) but seems to offer some compromise.\n- The Environmental League emphasizes ecological improvement (B3) and seems flexible on employment rules (C4 preferred, but not insisted).\n- The Mayor suggests support for the labor union with C2 and appears to opt for a higher federal loan with D2.\n- Other cities seek compensation and appear comfortable with supporting the local labor union (C2) but would prefer a lower federal loan (D3).\n\nBalancing these interests, I'll propose a deal that respects our high priority of Employment Rules, takes into consideration the Mayor's balanced approach, and acknowledges the Department of Tourism's preference for fiscal responsibility. To bridge the gap, I would look at moderate federal loan support.\n\nProposal: A2 (our score 20), C2 (our score 35), with an aim to accommodate the Mayor's preferences.

The SportCo proposal has the highest score that meets my threshold, followed by the Mayor's proposal. However, the Mayor's proposal includes C1, which is my most desired outcome, but it might not be acceptable to other parties. Given that the SportCo proposal was something I previously agreed upon, and it has a high score, it seems the most realistic to push forward while also accommodating others.\n \nFrom previous interactions, we know the following:\n- \"Department of Tourism\" proposed a federal loan of D3 which scores lower for us. They might agree to D2, which is better for us.\n- \"Other cities\" would agree to E3 instead of E2 if necessary, which is better for our score.\n- \"SportCo\" seems flexible on environmental issues (B2) but firm on their development plans (A2) and federal loan scale (D2).\n- \"Environmental League\" is very concerned about the infrastructure mix (prefers A3) and ecological impact (B2), but their proposed deal has the lowest score for us. With A3 not being an option for us, we must push for A2.\n\nBased on this analysis, we have a good baseline from the SportCo proposal that aligns reasonably well with the preferences of others, and perhaps we could alter the compensation to other cities (E3) as a compromise.\n\nSo, a proposed deal that seems reasonable while keeping an eye on the preferences of other parties would be: A2, B2, C2, D2, E3.\nLet's evaluate this proposed compromise:\n\nA2 (20) + B2 (0) + C2 (35) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 81\nThis score is above my minimum threshold and also seems like a compromise that could cater to the interests of the majority, possibly satisfying the concerns of the Department of Tourism (while still keeping a fairly substantial federal loan), the Environmental League (given the previous openness to B2), and maybe the Other Cities (assuming they can move from E2 to E3).\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter considering the positions of all parties, I believe we can agree on a deal that is sustainable and economically beneficial.

It is essential to support options C2 and D2 strongly as they significantly impact the score. Maintaining flexibility around E while holding firm on D is the focus. Given the necessity to reach a deal where SportCo and Department of Tourism's support is crucial, there is limited room to alter D2, but E3 might still be negotiable into E4 if required for an agreement.

Since employment rules are also important, maintaining at least a C2 option for jobs will ensure the Local Labour Union's considerable support. An option such as C1 would be even more preferable, but it does not seem to have gained traction thus far and therefore might not be agreed upon by other parties.\n\nI previously intended to test the feasibility of E3 with Other Cities, and since E3 appears in the majority of proposals, I will incorporate that in the final suggestion as it seems an acceptable middle ground for other parties as well. \n\nAlso noting that the Environmental League has twice proposed deals with B2, a score of 8, which suggests a willingness to maintain ecological balance could be within reasonable limits.\n\nNow, to present a balanced deal, considering the implied preferences of the Department of Tourism and SportCo, my priority issues are funding from the Department of Tourism (D2) and preference by the Local Labour Union (C2). I will opt for A2 since A3 eliminates all points for me and A1 does not seem realistic based on the Environmental League's stance.\n\nTherefore, my proposal (while I prefer C1) would be A2, B2, C2, D2, and E3 to align with other proposals, but my deal will still exceed my acceptable minimum score of 30, and it aligns with most parties' proposals:\n\nMy Proposal: A2 (8) + B2 (8) + C2 (18) + D2 (30) + E3 (4) \nTotal Score = 8 + 8 + 18 + 30 + 4 = 68\n\nThis score is well above my minimum requirement.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter thoughtful consideration of every party's interests and previous suggestions, I propose we agree on <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>, a balanced plan that respects environmental concerns, ensures economic growth, and recognizes our city's labor interests and other cities' demands.\n</ANSWER>", "public_answer": "\nAfter thoughtful consideration of every party's interests and previous suggestions, I propose we agree on <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>, a balanced plan that respects environmental concerns, ensures economic growth, and recognizes our city's labor interests and other cities' demands.\n"}, {"agent": "Other cities", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 6 interactions <HISTORY> .
