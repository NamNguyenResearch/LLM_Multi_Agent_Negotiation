It also grants a high federal loan (D1) which we prefer to be lesser (D4). Perhaps we can suggest a variation that slightly lowers the federal loan and increases compensation.\n\nConsidering that the Mayor, Local Labour Union, and SportCo all favored a deal with the federal loan staying at D1, we have to accept that it is unlikely to change their minds on that issue. However, SportCo may prefer a higher compensation if it meant other benefits in the deal such as a less restrictive employment rule (C4). \n\nThe Environmental League is primarily concerned with ecological impact (B3) and has been accommodative to a mid-ground on other issues. \n\nMy proposal should still honor that the Local Labour Union would like strong job preference (C1 or C2) and cater slightly more towards our interests in compensation (Moving towards E1 or E2).\n\nLet's do one adjustment to the existing deal that could be more favorable to us and also appeal to the other parties:\nDegree of change:\nE3 (30) -> E2 (45) An increase in compensation.\nD1 (0) -> D2 (8) A slight decrease in federal loan to align with our preference.\n\nThe deal to consider is: A2, B2, C2, D2, E2.\nCalculating the score for this updated deal:\nA2 (4), B2 (0), C2 (8), D2 (8), E2 (45)\nTotal score = 4 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 45 = 65\n\nThis deal scores significantly above our minimum acceptable score of 31 and also meets the likely preferences of the other parties, as it does not strongly deviate from the status quo.

However, it's also essential to consider that the Department of Tourism has a critical vote due to their veto power, and their last suggestion matches the Local Labour Union's. Moreover, the Environmental League and the Mayor previously suggested deals that are not far off from this. \n\nIt seems the sticking points are mostly centered around Federal Loan (Issue D) and potentially the infrastructure mix (Issue A). Issue D is critical to us, and we need to keep pushing for a higher loan to ensure the project's financial viability. On the other hand, the Environmental League and Other Cities are more inclined toward respecting environmental concerns and compensation, which corresponds to Issues B and E.\n\nKnowing this, I can propose a new deal to balance SportCo's preferences with others while trying to increase the total score and strive for the Department of Tourism's buy-in, which is crucial. Therefore, aiming for an increase in the federal loan might be a strategic move. I can also show flexibility in the compensation to other cities, possibly moving from E3 to E2 to increase the chance of overall approval, especially since Other Cities suggested a lower federal loan at D3, which we might need to offset with a higher compensation.\n\nNow, let's calculate what the score would look like with an improved federal loan and altered compensation (compromise between their initial positions):\nProposed deal:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D1 (35) + E2 (5) = 60\n\nThis deal gets closer to maximizing my score, meeting my critical need for a higher loan, while making notable concessions to the other parties on compensation.

D3 (13) is acceptable to me and would increase the scores.\n- Issue E (Compensation): My preferred option is E1 (60), but the consensus seems to be hovering around E3 (30). E2 (45) would be a better outcome for me than E3 and is worth pushing for.\n\nCalculating scores for the deals suggested by others:\n\n- Department of Tourism suggested: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E3 (30) = 50\n- My previous suggestion: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D3 (13) + E3 (30) = 55\n- SportCo's suggestion: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D1 (0) + E2 (45) = 57\n- Mayor and Local Labour Union's last suggestion: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D1 (0) + E3 (30) = 42\n\nGiven the current scores, SportCo's suggestion thus far gives me the highest score (57). However, I would ideally want a smaller federal loan (D3) to reserve funds for future projects.

The Labor Union has shown no preference for protecting ecological impact strictly, so they are okay with B2. The Department of Tourism seems okay with a smaller federal loan (D3).

This is still below my minimum threshold of 55. However, every other party is showing a preference towards B2 and A2 is the common ground found for the Infrastructure Mix. Since I must ensure a deal that meets my minimum threshold, I'll need to stand firm on B2 for Ecological Impact.\n\nI understand the Department of Tourism's preference for a lower federal loan (D3), the Labor Union seems to prefer C2, while both \"Other cities\" and the Department of Tourism lean towards E2 for the compensation to other cities.\n\nConsidering these preferences, the final proposal that should meet my minimum score and satisfy the other parties would be a combination of A2, B2, C2, D3, E2.
