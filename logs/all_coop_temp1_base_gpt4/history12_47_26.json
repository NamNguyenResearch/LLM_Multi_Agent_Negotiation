Let's consider our least favourite options to see how much we can compromise while still staying above 31. We must get at least E3 ($300 million) since E4 ($150 million) would require maximum scores on all other issues, which is unlikely given the other parties' interests.\n\nE3 = 30\n\nAt this point, we need at least one more point to meet our minimum threshold. Let\u2019s see if we can offer a compromise that would entice SportCo and align with the needs of the other parties. The Environmental League would likely prefer A3; however, this might be our bargaining chip to gain their support in the compensation negotiations, thus we could go for A2, which is a middle ground and gives us some points.\n\nA2 = 4\nC2 = 8 (our next best option that might appeal to the Union and is a compromise between C1 and C4)\nD3 = 13 (lower federal funding, which we prefer)\n\nWith these choices, our score would now be:\n\nE3 (30) + A2 (4) + C2 (8) + D3 (13) = 55 \n\nThis is well above our threshold of 31. The Environmental League and Mayor will likely appreciate B2 or B3 which have positive environmental impacts, and it doesn\u2019t affect our score.\n\nConsidering SportCo's proposal, it seems they prioritize A1, B1, and C4. They might be flexible with D1 since it's not their money but a loan, and it could be better for them to have a lower loan to repay. Also, SportCo is likely to be resistant to E1, so E3 might be a good compromise as it gives us a high score while being more palatable to them.\n\nNow, let's propose a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nWe appreciate SportCo's vision and propose a slightly modified approach to accommodate all parties: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E3 </DEAL>.

Here are some potential concessions we could make in descending order of our priority:\n- If strong resistance to E3, consider suggesting E2, which still gives us a decent score.\n- If pushback on C2, confirm alliance with the Local Labour Union to advocate for union preference to protect our interest in maintaining a level playing field for employment costs.\n- If D3 is a point of contention, we could propose D2 as an alternative, ensuring the Department of Tourism saves funds but also showing some flexibility towards funding.\n- Maintain A2 as the lowest acceptable infrastructure mix to secure points there but be open to other permutations that don't drop our score below the threshold.\nBe prepared to emphasize the mutual benefits and address concerns the Environmental League, Local Labour Union, and Mayor might have regarding environmental and employment aspects.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nWe appreciate SportCo's vision and propose a slightly modified approach to accommodate all parties: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E3 </DEAL>.

But since they have voiced their concerns about compensation, we may need to offer a token gesture \u2013 proposing E4, a lower compensation amount, might be a fair compromise.\n\nWhen it comes to the infrastructure mix (Issue A), we prioritize water-based infrastructure, but it seems an A2 option is more favorable to Other Cities and potentially the Environmental League. We would maintain A1 in our proposal as it's our preferred option, but A2 would be considered in the next stages if required to reach an agreement.\n\nFor ecological impact (Issue B), we will consider leaning towards B2, that balances both our needs and environmental concerns, even though our preference is for B1.\n\nOn the employment rules (Issue C), it's vital for us to maintain as much flexibility as possible, but to show our willingness to compromise, we are ready to move from our preferred C4 to C3.\n\nWith the above considerations, here's a possible counterproposal:\n\nA1 (14) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D1 (35) + E4 (15) = 81\n\nThis deal scores above our minimum threshold and gives some ground on ecological impact and employment rules, while still pushing for our preferred options on federal loan and compensation to other cities.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nWe recognize the need to balance environmental responsibility and economic opportunities.

However, looking at the previous deals suggested by other parties, none of them presented a combination of A3 and B3 which would be my ideal deal. All offers contain A2, which scores 22 for me. Therefore, to push for my environmental concerns, I would have to argue for B3 which scores the highest for me and is essential to reaching an acceptable deal. Given that A2 seems to be a reoccurring theme and that I am flexible with the other issues, I will have to agree to A2.\n\nSince issue B is more weighted in my scoring than A, I can afford to concede on A2 (a score of 22), if I can ensure that B3 (a score of 55) is part of the deal. A2+B3 alone gets me to a total score of 77, which is well above my minimum threshold of 55.\n\nAssuming the other parties have not shared their scores, we can try to deduce their preferences based on the options they've included in their deals. Considering their suggestions, it seems that:\n- A2 is a common ground for infrastructure, potentially due to less environmental impact compared to A1 and more development freedom than A3.\n- B2 appears to be accepted by multiple parties except the Department of Tourism and me who have considered B3.\n- C2 and C3 seem to vary, indicating flexibility around the employment rule.\n- D2 is consistent, possibly indicating a preference for middle-ground federal loan assistance.\n- E3 and E4 are varying, with a tendency towards compensating the other cities but with different amounts.\n\nGiven the above observations and my previous plan, I should propose a deal that includes A2, B3, and a combination of issues C, D, and E that aligns with the Department of Tourism and possibly the Local Labour Union, since SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power.

C1 is favored by the Local Labour Union and the Mayor but does not work for us. C2 is acceptable but C3 may get wider support including the Department of Tourism.
