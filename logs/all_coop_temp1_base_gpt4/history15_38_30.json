They seem open to compromising to some extent on ecological issues, as B2 was frequently suggested, but B3 is preferred for achieving the highest environmental standards, which is paramount to the Environmental League.\n\nConsidering this and noting the combinations proposed by others, SportCo is inclined towards A2 and B2, which seems like a mid-ground compromise but does not meet the required environmental score. However, examining the Department of Tourism, Other cities, Mayor, and Local Labour Union's preferences, they\u2019re more favorable to solutions that balance ecological and financial aspects.\n\nAdding the scores from the proposal with the highest ecological consideration included from the other parties (A3, B3, C2, D3, E2), we obtain:\n- A3 (45)\n- B3 (55)\nThis results in a score of 100 just from these high-priority issues.\n\nSince I have a minimum of 55 required and I have to focus on maximizing the ecological outcome, which aligns with the preferences of some other parties too, I should suggest a deal that maintains A3 and B3.\n\nThe Department of Tourism and SportCo are key parties for approval and they expressed interest in a D2 federal loan. Even though D3 was proposed by Other cities and can work as a compromise.\n\nFor employment (Issue C) and compensation (Issue E), they are less important to us but essential to other parties like the Local Labour Union and Other cities. Identifying a compromise on these, such as maintaining a union quota and reasonable compensation, will be helpful.\n\nPossible deal proposal considering the above analysis:\n<DEAL> A3, B3, C2, D2, E3 </DEAL>\n\nThis proposal maintains the highest priority for ecological standards (B3) and the use of land-based infrastructure (A3), which has the full score from the Environmental League.

However, D2 (8) might be acceptable if we have to compromise to make a deal.\n\nC - Employment Rules: \nWe support the Local Labour Union, preferring C1 (12), but again, could consider C2 (8) if it complements other more favorable options.\n\nA - Infrastructure Mix: \nThough not our highest priority, we would like A3 (10), but in the spirit of compromise, we are prepared to consider A2 (4).\n\nB - Ecological Impact: \nWe have no preference for this aspect, so any option works as it doesn\u2019t change our score.\n\nNow, let's see what combinations could work based on the current situation:\nBest case scenario: E1 (60) + D4 (18) + C1 (12) + A3 (10) would give us the perfect score, but it's unrealistic given the talks so far.\n\nTo reach our minimum score threshold of 31, let's calculate a few potential compromises:\n- E2 (45) + D3 (13) + C2 (8) + A2 (4) = 70\nThis would be above our acceptable threshold and may be agreeable to others since versions of it have been proposed already.\n\n- E3 (30) + D2 (8) + C2 (8) + A2 (4) = 50\nThis combo is also above the threshold and aligns with recent proposals from the other parties, showing that E3 is possibly accepted by others.\n\nConsidering the deals already on the table, and the importance of making a proposal that could be acceptable by others, particularly the ones with veto power such as SportCo and the Department of Tourism, it seems wise to propose a deal that leans towards E3, with either D2 or D3, while accepting C2 and A2. This would not only respect the interests of other parties but also ensure that our minimum score is met or exceeded.\n\nWe need to ensure that SportCo and the Department of Tourism feel like they are getting a good deal to secure their crucial approval, hence proposing no federal loan is highly unlikely to be accepted. Since other parties have leaned towards D2, and SportCo didn't propose D4 at all, it is wiser to stick with D2 for our proposal.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll opt for a proposal that seems to align most closely with what others may accept and still satisfies our needs:\n\nCalculating the deal:\nE3 (30) + D2 (8) + C2 (8) + A2 (4) + B2 (0) = 50\n\nThis meets our minimum threshold and seems to line up with where negotiations have been heading based on the history and preferences of other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the proposals from other parties and our own priorities, I suggest we consider <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 </DEAL> as a way forward to conclude our negotiation successfully.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nIn the following interaction, I will:\n- Be prepared to stick with A2 as it has been consistently suggested by others and myself.\n- Maintain C2 to align with the Local Labour Union and other parties\u2019 proposals.\n- Propose D3 if there's pushback on D2 to try and reduce the federal loan while keeping an eye on a favorable compensation outcome.\n- If negotiations on the compensation E get challenging, E2 will be my next favorable option, but I need to keep it at least E3 to meet my minimal acceptable score.\n- Listen to the objections or alternative proposals from other parties, particularly SportCo and the Department of Tourism, since they hold veto power.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nTaking into account the proposals from other parties and our own priorities, I suggest we consider <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 </DEAL> as a way forward to conclude our negotiation successfully.\n"}, {"agent": "Department of Tourism", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 6 interactions <HISTORY> .
