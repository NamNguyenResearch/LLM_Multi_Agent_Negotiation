They also have an interest in promoting sustainable development, which might align them somewhat with the Environmental League.\n\nPossible Proposal to Balance Interests:\n\n- For Issue A, I propose A2, as it is a compromise between A1 and A3, allowing some water-based infrastructure but with restrictions. This aligns somewhat with SportCo's interest in building freedom while also considering environmental and infrastructural preferences.\n- Issue B can be left to the Environmental League to contest as I have no preference. To build rapport with them, let's assume a neutral B2 option.\n- For Issue C, considering I support the Local Labour Union, I propose C2, a compromise approach where the union gets a 2:1 preference, helping to satisfy union interests but not completely alienating SportCo.\n- Issue D is important due to its impact on the budget for future projects; thus I'd aim for D3, a reduced federal loan amount that would still enable the project but not entirely strip the Department of Tourism's funds.\n- Most importantly, Issue E must be a higher compensation for other cities to offset potential losses from tourism.

However, I must be willing to compromise to ensure the deal exceeds my threshold score. With that in mind, I need to consider the preferences that have been coming up.\n\nConsidering the proposals that have come through and how they score for me:\nThe two highest scores are SportCo's and the Mayor's proposals (both at 83), but the Mayor\u2019s proposal includes B2, which has no impact on my score, thus indicating possible room for agreement with the Environmental League which prioritizes ecological impact (B3).\n\nI'm noticing that the Environmental League has shown flexibility in supporting proposals that include C2 instead of pushing for a lower union preference. However, since Employment Rules are my top priority, sticking to at least a C2 is essential to ensuring the union remains significantly involved.\n\nMy proposal would therefore maintain elements that cater to my preferences on C and D, while taking into account other parties' preferences as shown by their repeated choices for A2 and by giving room on E and B, where I can afford to compromise, keeping the focus on ecological improvement, which seems to be a consensus.\n\nThus, my proposition is A2, B3, C2, D2, E3.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate the thoroughness of the proposals presented.

Since this doesn't affect my score, I will support the consensus.\n- For Issue E, while I have no preference, I notice E3 has a majority preference, and given other parties care about this, I am willing to agree on it for the sake of reaching an agreement.\n\nNow, I will calculate the total score for the deals proposed most frequently:\nDeal with A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 would score 22 (from A2) + 25 (from B2) for a total of 47.\nDeal with A2, B3, C2, D2, E3 would score 22 (from A2) + 55 (from B3) for a total of 77.\n\nI need a score of at least 55 to agree to a deal.
