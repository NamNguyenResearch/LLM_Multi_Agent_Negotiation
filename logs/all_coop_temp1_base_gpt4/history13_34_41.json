We should maintain firm on A2 for job creation and E3 for fair compensation. If pushback on the federal loan amount (D2) continues, consider the implications of shifting to D3 if it helps to secure agreement on other priorities. Adjusting B2 could also be an option if it gets more buy-in from the Environmental League and potentially SportCo.\n", "\nFor the next round, I should revisit C3 to see if I can negotiate a better position for the union, potentially aiming for C2. If opposition to the union's preferred employment terms remains strong, I could explore the possibility of C2 and see if adjusting other areas, possibly D2 to D3 or E3 to E4, might be feasible to reach an overall better position, provided that these don't dip below my minimum score. A2 and B2 seem to have consensus.\n"]}, "finished_rounds": 25}
