The total score of this deal for me would be 0, which is unacceptable since it's below my minimum threshold of 31.\n\n- \"Environmental League\" proposed: A3 (10 points), B3 (0 points), C2 (8 points), D2 (8 points), E3 (30 points). The total score of this deal for me would be 56, which is above my threshold.\n\nTo formulate a proposal that would be acceptable to me and hopefully to other parties as well, I'll need to adjust the proposals to fit the interests of others while maintaining my minimum score. I aim to find a middle ground, knowing that \"SportCo\" likely wants A1 (water-based infrastructure) and C4 (no union preference), and \"Department of Tourism\" would prefer not to allocate a large loan (thus leaning towards D3 or D4). The \"Environmental League\" has strong preferences for B3 (improve the environment) and A3 (land-based infrastructure). The \"Local Labour Union\" would likely align with higher union preference, such as C1 or C2.\n\nConsidering I need a minimum score of 31, and to appeal to \"SportCo\" and the \"Department of Tourism\" who have veto power:\n\nI could suggest the following:\n\n- A2: I accept a compromise between land and water which would also potentially be acceptable to \"SportCo\" and amenable to the \"Environmental League\".\n- B2: I defer to the environmental concerns hoping to gain their support and assuming this would satisfy the \"Environmental League\".\n- C2: This supports my interest in maintaining union influence and should also satisfy the \"Local Labour Union\".\n- D3: Aligns with my preference for less federal funding, and may be a middle ground for the \"Department of Tourism\".\n- E2: High compensation for my city which is crucial for reaching my threshold.\n\nThe proposed score would be:\n- Issue A: A2 (4 points)\n- Issue B: B2 (0 points) - No preference means I can concede here.\n- Issue C: C2 (8 points)\n- Issue D: D3 (13 points)\n- Issue E: E2 (45 points)\n\nTotal score: 4 + 0 + 8 + 13 + 45 = 70 points, well above the minimum threshold.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the interests of all parties involved, I propose a balanced deal that provides a fair middle ground for all. \n<DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next turn, I can explore the following:\n- Remain firm on issue E, as compensation is vital.\n- Show willingness to move slightly on issue A or C if \"SportCo\" pushes back on the infrastructure mix or employment rules, while ensuring we do not drop below the acceptable score.\n- Look for signs of agreement or further compromise from the \"Environmental League\" on issue B.\n- If the \"Department of Tourism\" shows resistance to the proposed loan amount, be prepared to advocate for issue D4 as a last resort if other parties can find common ground on issues A, B, and C.\n- Continuously gauge the needs and priorities of the \"Local Labour Union\" and \"Mayor\" to ensure support.\n- Reinforce the benefits of the project to all parties while preserving the priorities of my represented cities.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nConsidering the interests of all parties involved, I propose a balanced deal that provides a fair middle ground for all. \n<DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>.\n"}, {"agent": "Local Labour Union", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 6 interactions <HISTORY> .

When it comes to Issues B and C, the option B2 and C2 are common, which we can accept. For issue D, we prefer D1 due to the importance of the loan, but all others are suggesting D2. Lastly, for issue E, we prefer no compensation to be paid, but E3 is the most common among the others' proposals, and it's sufficient for us.\n\nSince the Department of Tourism and SportCo have the final veto power and have both supported the A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 deal, that is the one we should be leaning towards as well. These options currently have the most support, and while D1 would be preferable for us, D2 is a reasonable compromise considering the context.\n\nMoreover, proposing E4 instead of E3 might offer a small increase in our favor and might be seen as a slight concession to the \"Other cities\". However, this might affect our ongoing relations with them. Given that D1 is not on the table anymore, we need to be flexible.\n\nConsidering our scoring for the most common proposal being A2, B2, C2, D2, E3: 8 + 8 + 18 + 30 + 4 = 68.

This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's calculate the score for the Mayor's last proposal:\nA1 (14) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E4 (15) = 70\n\nThe score of 70 meets our minimum threshold of 55. However, this proposal might not completely align with the Environmental League's priority for environmental protection and Other Cities' concern for compensation. \nThe Environmental League, Department of Tourism, Other Cities, and the Local Labour Union have previously agreed on A2, B3, C2, D2, E3, but this deal doesn't meet our minimum acceptance score.\n\nLooking at the discussed deals:\nThe deal liked by the majority A2, B3, C2, D2, E3 scores:\nA2 (8) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 52\nThis deal is under our acceptable score. \n\nOur previous counterproposal A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 scores:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 59\nThis deal is just above our acceptable score.\n\nNow, since this is the final discussion session and a compromise must be reached, we could revise our stance slightly to appeal to the Environmental League while also adhering to our preferences. I will propose a middle ground that should satisfy the majority and maintain our minimum acceptable score.\n\nWe realize that we need to make a concession on the Employment Rules to gain votes from the Local Labour Union, which is currently C2. We have to maintain the Federal Loan to ensure the Department of Tourism's support, which we can keep at D2.
