This is unacceptable as our minimum score threshold is 55, and our main concerns are with issues A and B.\n\nTo move towards a deal that is more likely to be accepted by all parties, I will need to prioritize concessions on issues A and B, since I am neutral about issues C, D, and E, and they carry no weight in my scoring. However, since SportCo prefers A1 and B1, they will likely resist moving too far from their initial positions on these points. Therefore, a compromise on these issues needs to be attractive to them.\n\nA possible compromise that allows construction on both land and water, while also improving the ecological balance, would be A2 and B3. This would grant SportCo some flexibility on the infrastructure mix while strongly protecting the environment.\n\nI'm assuming the Local Labour Union would prefer employment options that provide them more jobs (C1 or C2), while the Department of Tourism and other cities would like financial stability and compensation (prefer higher federal loan and higher compensation), but my preferences in these issues are neutral.\n\nA new proposal that shows flexibility and is significantly better for the Environmental League could be:\nA2 (22), B3 (55), C4 (0), D1 (0), E5 (0). This results in a total score of 77, which is above our minimum threshold of 55.\n\nThis proposal emphasizes environmental protection, which aligns with my objectives, while still allowing SportCo some flexibility in their infrastructure plans.

We also have to show flexibility considering the Environmental League has already moved towards the middle with an A2 proposal.\n\nTo create a proposal that could be more acceptable to all parties, we should take into account the strong environmental concerns and SportCo's interest in a water-based infrastructure, as well as our own high priority on employment rules. Federal Loan and compensation could potentially be areas of less contention.\n\nHere's a balanced proposal that I believe could work for SportCo with potentially high loans (appealing to the likelihood of success), limited water infrastructure (appealing to Environmental League and SportCo), high preference for the union (our highest priority), a middle ground on compensation (to address other cities' concerns) and no mention of ecological impact (since we have no preference):\n\nThe proposal would be:\nA2 (20) - We acknowledge the compromise the Environmental League made and agree on a mixed infrastructure, which maintains more job creation potential than a purely land-based option.\nB1 (0) or B2 (0) - We stay neutral; we are open to further discussion on environmental measures since we acknowledge Environmental League's concerns.\nC1 (42) - Our key issue; we push for maximum union preference for job distribution to ensure employment for our members.\nD1 (30) - A high federal loan increases the likelihood of the project's overall success, and should appeal to SportCo and the Department of Tourism.\nE3 (6) or E4 (8) - We need to strike a balance that considers the concerns of other cities.\n\nLet's try for the higher amount in the compensation to other cities to offer a concession there, in case they would not budge on employment rules or infrastructure mix (higher compensation might appease them):\n\nOur proposed deal:\nA2 (20) + B2 (0) + C1 (42) + D1 (30) + E4 (8) = 100 points\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nUnderstanding the positions suggested by both SportCo and the Environmental League, I propose the following balanced approach: <DEAL> A2, B2, C1, D1, E4 </DEAL>.

They are focusing on the environmental impact, which we are neutral about, so we can be flexible here.\n\nThe Local Labour Union proposed A2, B2, C1, D1, E4, aligning partially with our interest in supporting unionized jobs.\n\nSportCo then adjusted their proposal to A2, B2, C2, D1, E4, showing willingness to compromise on the infrastructure, ecological impact, and employment rules, but not on the loan amount or compensation.\n\nThe Mayor supports SportCo's latest proposal, so we need to consider their preference for this deal to pass.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the score of the current deal (A2, B2, C2, D1, E4) according to our preferences:\nA2 = 4\nB2 = 0\nC2 = 8\nD1 = 0\nE4 = 15\n\nTotal score for us with the current deal is: 4 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 15 = 27\nThis is below our minimum threshold of 31; thus, we cannot agree to this deal as it stands.\n\nSince the compensation is our highest priority, we should focus on increasing it.

We need to negotiate a deal that meets our minimum score requirement and satisfies the Department of Tourism and other parties. \n\nUsing their previous responses, I can see that the Environmental League values B3, and they also seem flexible with A2, and the Department of Tourism also supports B3, but they are concerned about fiscal responsibility, which influences their view on D2.
