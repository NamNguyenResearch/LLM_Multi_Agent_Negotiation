We could trade off on another issue for this concession.\n- If any party strongly opposes A2, we could potentially explore the benefits of having land-based or a mixed approach, but we must be careful not to compromise on the compensation or federal loan too much.\n- In relation to B3 and environmental concerns, we can highlight the PR benefits and long-term cost savings associated with environmental protection, attempting to secure this as a common goal.\n- Continue to emphasize the importance of E2 or even propose to slightly alter the compensation, E1, if necessary, to ensure sufficient offset for the anticipated losses to other cities' tourism.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "Given the various interests at stake, I propose we converge on a solution that carefully balances development, environment, and employment while ensuring fair compensation and financial prudence: <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>.
