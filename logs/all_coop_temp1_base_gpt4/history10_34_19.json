It's important to aim for a higher score while attempting to satisfy the other parties' central concerns where possible.\n\nThe Environmental League's priority seems to be on the environment (Issue B), with a preference for B3, which we rated the lowest. To find a middle ground, B2 is a compromise that gives them more of what they want than B1, without going for their maximum preference. Regarding Issue A, we can see they are open to A2, which still provides us with a decent score. \n\nThe Local Labour Union's critical issue is job creation for their members, hence their preference for C1. We might not be able to go that far, but we can move from C4 to C3, improving employment opportunities for the union, even if not as much as they desire. \n\nWe cannot compromise on Issue D because it's our most important issue, and we want to stick with D1 if possible. As for Issue E, we have some degree of flexibility, although we prefer E5, we can offer a compromise to meet other cities halfway.\n\nGiven the above consideration, let's suggest a new deal that addresses our priorities and accommodates others where possible:\n\nProposed compromise:\n- Infrastructure Mix (Issue A): We stick with A2 to address the Environmental League's concerns.\n- Ecological Impact (Issue B): We opt for B2, which is a middle ground between our preference and the Environmental League's.\n- Employment Rules (Issue C): We could move to C3 to give the Local Labour Union some preference but not to the extent of C1.\n- Federal Loan (Issue D): We aim to maintain D1 as this is a critical issue for us.\n- Compensation to Other Cities (Issue E): We can move to E3 as a compromise, providing some compensation without fully giving in.\n\nLet's calculate the score for this proposed compromise:\n\nDeal = A2(8) + B2(7) + C3(10) + D1(35) + E3(10) = 70\n\nThis score is above our minimum threshold and provides a higher likelihood of satisfying the major concerns of the Environmental League and Local Labour Union without overly compromising our position.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nThank you for your proposals.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nFirst, I'll review all the proposals made and the options to find a compromise: \n\n- SportCo started with a proposal that prioritizes their freedom in infrastructure and financial support while not offering any concessions to environmental concerns or other cities (A1, B1, C4, D1, E5).\n\n- The Environmental League offered a proposal that takes environmental concerns as a top priority, which would not be aligned with the priorities of SportCo and the Mayor (A2, B3, C4, D1, E5).\n\n- The Local Labour Union offered a proposal valuing job security, a moderate approach to the environment, and some concessions to other cities (A2, B2, C1, D1, E3).\n\n- SportCo's second proposal moved towards the middle ground on ecology and jobs, while still preferring a substantial federal loan and some compensation to other cities (A2, B2, C3, D1, E3).\n\n- The Other cities suggested a deal that would cost more to SportCo and more restrictions on employment for Local Labour unions but went along with the shared infrastructure choice and ecological concerns (A2, B2, C2, D1, E2).\n\n\nLooking at the history of interactions, the following pattern emerges:\n\n- All except for SportCo's first proposal prefer infrastructure approach A2.\n- B2 and B3 for ecological impact seem to be acceptable to most, except for SportCo's initial B1.\n- Employment rules have fluctuated, but positions C1 and C3 have been brought up; C4 is my favorable preference but it was only mentioned in the initial bid.\n- The federal loan of $3 billion (D1) is consistent across all proposals, indicating SportCo's preference for higher investment likely.\n- Compensation to other cities varies, with E3 being the midpoint that has already been suggested twice.\n\nKeeping these observations in mind and considering each party's likely preferences, I am going to suggest a balanced proposal.\n\nGiven that \"SportCo\" has proposed D1 in every instance, it's a central element to consider. Since I prefer to pay less, I would like to try to lower it but still understand \"SportCo\" is likely to resist. They've already shown a willingness to move on the ecological impact and employment rule issues.\n\nGiven that all parties except \"SportCo\" have avoided A1, it seems A2 is a common ground. \n\nEmployment rules seem to be contentious, with \"SportCo\" and the \"Local Labour Union\" having quite different views. Unsure about their willingness to compromise, it might be worth exploring middle ground.\n\nIssue B seems to be leaning towards B2 as a compromise between the environmental league and SportCo's positions. \n\nFor compensation to other cities, I will aim for E3 as it's a fair middle ground and has been previously suggested.\n\nMy proposal looks like this:\n\nA: A2 - Compromise on infrastructure that's acceptable to most parties (11 points).\nB: B2 - A balance between protecting wildlife and allowing the project to proceed (20 points).\nC: C3 - A middle ground for employment rules that shows some preference for the local union (4 points).\nD: D2 - Less than what \"SportCo\" desires but at a level to show continued commitment (26 points).\nE: E3 - Fair compensation and previously suggested (15 points).\n\nThis deal would give me a total score of 76 (11 + 20 + 4 + 26 + 15), which is above my minimum threshold of 65.

The goal is to create an agreement that has as high an ecological benefit as possible while keeping in mind that the minimum score I can accept is 55.

As for Issue B, maintaining or improving the local ecology is a top priority, so I want to hold firm for B3.\n\nChecking other parties' proposals, they are as follows:\n- Local Labour Union: A2 (22) + B2 (25)\n- Department of Tourism: A2 (22) + B3 (55)\n- SportCo: A2 (22) + B2 (25)\n- Other cities: A2 (22) + B2 (25)\n- Mayor: A2 (22) + B3 (55)\n\nI must prioritize proposals that include B3 to ensure a high enough score, though a proposal with A3 would be the optimal agreement.\n\nThe Department of Tourism and the Mayor's suggestion include B3. However, both include options that are not within my concern from issues C-E.
