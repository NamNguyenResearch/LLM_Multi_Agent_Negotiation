While SportCo proposes no preference for the union (C4), the mayor\u2019s office would ideally prefer C1.\n\nWithout compromising the project's approval, I should aim to adjust the proposal to better reflect this without significantly diminishing the overall score.

SportCo might aim for A1 and B1 due to lesser restrictions, which aligns with the mayor's preference but we must keep an eye on the environmentalists' reaction.\n\nRegarding the Department of Tourism, which must approve the loan, there's added value in maintaining option D1 to ensure that SportCo can successfully complete the project.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn response to SportCo's proposal, I suggest the following adjustments for a balanced deal: <DEAL> A1, B1, C1, D1, E3 </DEAL>.
