The options C1, D1, and A2 align most closely with our interests.

A compromise on the E issue may also be required since E3 seems to have been mentioned by every other party except for SportCo, so it could be a middle ground.\n\nAt this point, a proposal that builds on the Mayor's and accommodates Other cities' and SportCo's concerns might be a path forward. Since they have suggested reasonable amounts for the federal loan that are in the range of our high interest, this suggests that D1 or D2 would work for us. \n\nSo a proposal might look like:\nEmployment - C1, Infrastructure - A2, Ecological Impact - B2 or B3, Federal Loan - D2, Compensation - E3.\n\nLet's calculate the score:\nA2 (20) + B2 or B3 (0) + C1 (42) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 88 or higher if we consider B3.\nSince we are open to compromise, we will propose B2, which has been repeatedly mentioned in the previous deals by other parties, it is likely to be accepted.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account previous proposals and the need for a successful collaboration, I would like to propose a deal that ensures job opportunities for our local workforce while balancing environmental considerations and economic benefit: <DEAL> A2, B2, C1, D2, E3 </DEAL>.

Environmental League wants B3 but I believe that as B2 already maintains balance, it is an acceptable compromise.\nC2 (5) -> Other Cities proposed C2, and although we prefer C4, we might need to offer some concession here to reach an agreement.\nD2 (29) -> This is a common choice across several proposals and is acceptable to us. We asked for D1 but we understand that D2 might be more realistic. \nE3 (10) -> Chosen by many parties and a better option for us when compared to E1 or E2.\n\nThe score for this deal would be: 8 + 7 + 5 + 29 + 10 = 59\nThis score is above the minimum 55 required and still reflects some key preferences of the other parties.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate everyone's efforts in seeking a balanced solution.

Since SportCo has veto power, satisfying their preferences is key, and they are likely to prefer higher federal loan amounts.

It's also crucial to keep in mind the veto power of \"SportCo\" and the \"Department of Tourism\". Noting their preferences, they seem to be fine with D2, which also works for me since it is of significant importance.

Similarly, E3 (compensation to other cities) seems to be a consistent choice which we should accept. For A2, there is a consensus which we should maintain.\n\nThe critical point is the 'Employment Rules' (Issue C). While the Union obviously prefers C1, many parties are leaning toward C2. Since the score difference between C1 and C2 is 42 - 35 = 7 points, if we can achieve an agreement on C1, we would want to do so. However, if that proves to be difficult, we may consider conceding to C2 in exchange for favorable terms on other issues.\n\nThe 'Federal Loan' (Issue D) is important, and D2 has the support of key parties and would be an acceptable outcome for the Union. Here the union can be flexible since the score difference between D1 and D2 is only 10 points.\n\nLet's calculate a deal that could satisfy all parties based on current preferences, potentially conceding on B and C for strategic advantage:\n\nA2 (20) + B3 (0) + C2 (35) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 81\n\nThis offer retains high scores for union jobs, provides an acceptable federal loan amount, and is in line with the majority consensus on environmental and compensation issues, potentially paving the way for a deal.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the positions of all parties, I would like to make a proposal that balances our fundamental priorities with the broader consensus: <DEAL> A2, B3, C2, D2, E3 </DEAL>.

It seems there could be room to negotiate down from D2, but for now, I'll calculate using D2 as indicated by prior discussions.\n- Issue E (Compensation to Other Cities): E3 gets a score of 30.\n\nCalculating the score of the deal suggested by SportCo and the Department of Tourism: A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D2 (8) + E3 (30) = 50. This score is above the minimum score of 31 and aligns with the previous suggestions from other parties which favored this deal combination. It seems like a deal with this combination can secure approval from the necessary parties.\n\nConsidering other parties' preferences:\n- Environmental League has shown preference for B3 and has leaned towards C1, but that would not be favorable for us.\n- The Mayor has favored A2, B2, C1, which we'd consider if we had to negotiate further on employment rules.\n- The Local Labour Union has also shown an inclination towards B3 and C1.\n- Department of Tourism has agreed with SportCo's proposal, which is suitable for us.\n\nThinking about others' preferences, it seems like the preference of the Environmental League for higher ecological commitment (B3) is an outlier when looking at the consensus building around B2. Still, it's important to maintain a balanced position also considering the need for SportCo's and Department of Tourism's approval.\n\nSince the suggested by SportCo and the Department of Tourism A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 deal seems most balanced and aligns with the preference of most parties including ours, I will propose this as our final agreement while emphasizing the importance of reaching a consensus.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter careful consideration and listening to all parties, I am prepared to support the balanced resolution put forward by SportCo and the Department of Tourism.
