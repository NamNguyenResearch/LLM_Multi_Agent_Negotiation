This is the least favorable for us.\n\nThe Environmental League's proposal is A3(10), B3(0), C2(8), D2(8), E4(15) which totals 41 points. This is favorable as it meets our minimum score requirement.\n\nSportCo's compromise is A2(4), B2(0), C3(6), D1(0), E4(15) which totals 25 points.

This is the highest score among the proposals and significantly exceeds our minimum score requirement.\n\nBased on this analysis, we need to focus on increasing the compensation (Issue E), pushing for a smaller federal loan (Issue D), and supporting the local labor union (Issue C) while being flexible on the infrastructure mix (Issue A). Since we have no preference for the ecological impact (Issue B), we can be flexible there as well.\n\nA good compromise could be A3, as it aligns with the Environmental League's interests and carries a high score for us. C1 would be ideal, as it supports our unionized cities, but C2 may be more acceptable to all parties involved. For D, we prefer D3 or D4, but given the need for compromise, D2 is a middle ground we could live with. E2 offers us a good compensation while being better than what some parties have proposed.\n\nThe Department of Tourism's offer is strong for us but could be improved on the compensation (Issue E).

The \"Other cities\" have suggested A3 twice, which is preferred from my perspective, as it's land-based and aligns with my environmental concerns.\n\nIssue B: B2 (\"Maintain balance\") has been consistently offered, which gets me 25 points and satisfies my ecological interests to some extent.\n\nI have no scores for C, D, or E, but they're essential to others. Therefore, we can use these issues to negotiate better terms on A and B.\n\nThe latest proposal from \"Other cities\" with A3 is ideal for me given the environmental priority. On employment, it seems the Mayor, Local Labour Union, and Department of Tourism are comfortable with C1. So, if I endorse C1, that can sway them possibly to agree on stronger environmental options like A3 and B2, even though B3 would be ideal.\n\nThe Department of Tourism seems to be aiming for a lower federal loan (suggested D3), and I'm not concerned with the amount. \"Other cities\" and the Department of Tourism seem aligned on D3 as well.

Department of Tourism: \nColleagues, let's move forward with a balanced agreement that addresses environmental priorities and employment opportunities while maintaining responsible funding. I propose: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>. This stays true to our common interests and appears to be in line with what could be mutually acceptable, considering the positions expressed.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \nIf the proposal <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E2 </DEAL> is well-received, I can suggest this as the final vote in the next session. However, if further negotiation is needed:\n- Be open to a shift between B2 and B1 for additional SportCo value if other parties are flexible.\n- C3 is our best compromise for employment but be willing to discuss C2 if absolutely necessary for agreement.\n- Stick firmly to D2 as a federal loan is a critical issue and has already been indicated as acceptable.\n- E2 already leans toward the middle ground; offer E3 as a last resort to solidify agreement if needed, but no lower.\n\nBe prepared to finalize on these options while emphasizing the mutual benefits to all parties and the positive impacts of the Harbour Sport Park project on the local economy and community.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. This is the final discussion session. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>. The scratchpad is secret and not seen by other parties. \n        Your final answer is public and must never contain scores. Enclose your final answer after the scratchpad between <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>. \n        Make your final answer very short and brief in 2-3 sentences and containing only your main proposals. \n        Use options' short notations instead of long descriptions. \n        Enclose any deals you suggest between: <DEAL> </DEAL>. \"\n        ", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's evaluate the most recent deals and the preferences:\n\n- The Local Labour Union, Mayor, Environmental League, and Other Cities support: <DEAL> A2, B3, C1, D2, E3 </DEAL>\n- Department of Tourism supports: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>\n- My previous offer was: <DEAL> A2, B2, C3, D2, E2 </DEAL>\n\nLet's calculate the scores for each deal:\n\nFor the Local Labour Union/Mayor/Other Cities-supported deal:\nA2 (8) + B3 (0) + C1 (0) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 47 (This is below my minimum acceptable score of 55)\n\nFor the Department of Tourism-supported deal:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 64 (This exceeds my minimum)\n\nFor my previous proposal:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E2 (5) = 59 (This exceeds my minimum but is less than the Department of Tourism-supported deal)\n\nIt seems that the Department of Tourism-supported deal has a better score and should be agreeable to most parties since it aligns closely with the others' preferences, except for the \"Other cities\" preferring a higher compensation.\n\nConsidering others' preferences, a solid middle ground appears to be:\n- Keeping A2: This aligns with the majority and allows some water-based development.\n- Moving to B3 could ensure the Environmental League's support but that won't be acceptable for SportCo.\n- Accepting C3/C2 as a compromise for the Local Labour Union's preference while still allowing us to hire non-union workers.\n- Maintaining D2 as a loan amount since this is critical and was the Department of Tourism-backed figure.\n- Offering E3 as a compensation to other cities which seems like their lower boundary.\n\nThe final proposal I will suggest keeps the Department of Tourism's preferred position intact, which is vital as they have veto power. It offers necessary concessions to other parties while ensuring SportCo's minimum score is met or exceeded.\n\nFinal proposal calculation:\nA2 (8) + B2 (7) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 64 (Exceeds minimum score)\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nGiven the priorities and constraints expressed by all parties involved, I propose a balanced deal that aligns with our collective goals and acknowledges the importance of environmental considerations, employment for our local workforce, adequate funding, and fair nurturing of our regional partnerships.
