However, they seem to focus on issue B.\n\nMy goal is to prioritize Employment (issue C) but also maintain a balanced deal that can be accepted by all parties. The Mayor's suggestion benefits me the most, but it might be less likely to be accepted by other parties due to the high federal loan amount (D1). My previous suggestion scored 81, which is above my minimum threshold.\n\nSeeing the common selections across proposals: A2 is preferred by all for issue A. Issue B is the one where commitments vary, but B2 seems to have general acceptability except for the Environmental League that strongly favors B3. SportCo and the Department of Tourism have not disclosed a strong position on issue C, and the chosen option by most is C2 or C3. Issue D is split between 1 and 2 billion. For Issue E, most are leaning towards E3.\n\nConsidering this, I might propose a new deal aiming to reach an equilibrium among the preferences reflected and my own scores.\n\nPotential new proposal could be: A2 (20) from all parties, B2 (0) considering wide acceptance, C2 (35) aiming for a higher employment preference, D2 (20) as it balances Tourism's and my interests, and E3 (6) as it is a compromise between no compensation and very high compensation.\n\nCalculating the potential new proposal's score: A2 (20) + B2 (0) + C2 (35) + D2 (20) + E3 (6) = 81\n\nThe score of 81 is above my minimum threshold of 50, aligns best with a broad range of other parties' preferences, and represents the greatest potential for a balanced deal.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering everyone's points, I'd like to propose a compromise that seems to suit most preferences while still looking out for our local jobs: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 </DEAL>.
