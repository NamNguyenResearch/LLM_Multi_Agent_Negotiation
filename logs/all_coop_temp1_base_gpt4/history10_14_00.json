A proposal leaning towards A2 balances infrastructure development with environmental considerations, which might be better received by the \"Environmental League\".\n\nAn option that includes B2 prioritizes maintaining environmental balance, aligning with the \"Environmental League's\" preferences, and is still somewhat acceptable for us.\n\nWe should keep C1 to ensure strong support from the \"Local Labour Union\".\n\nFor federal loans, we should stay with D1 for the maximum financial support, which is crucial for this project.\n\nConcerning compensations to other cities (E), we don't want to upset neighboring mayors.

The Local Labour Union's latest proposal suggests they are pushing for C1; hence moving to C2 may help build a compromise.\n- Compensation (E): I ideally want E3 but can go as far as E4. There seems to be less resistance towards E3, so maintaining this in the proposal might be less controversial.\n\nMy new suggested proposal to build consensus could be:\nA2 (11) + B2 (20) + C2 (2) + D2 (26) + E3 (15) = 74\n\nThis proposal could satisfy SportCo's desire for A2, aligns with many parties' preference for B2, and offers a compromise on employment rules (C2).

The Mayor has suggested a high federal loan twice, which could mean D1 is important to them, and they have leaned toward land-based infrastructure (A2) and strong support for the Local Labour Union (C1). The \"Other Cities\" seem to be flexible with their compensation but still desire a significant amount, suggesting E2, and they\u2019ve also shown some flexibility on the federal loan (D2). \n\nGiven that we need the Department of Tourism's support and they have veto power, a larger federal loan is likely to be their preference as well. So, D1 would be appealing to them, and it\u2019s also our maximum preference with a score of 35 points. \n\nWe have a preference for C4, where we have no union preference, but it seems all other parties prefer some level of union involvement. A compromise on this issue might be necessary.\n\nBased on the scoring criteria provided, the combinations from the history that score above our minimum score of 55 are:\n\n1) A2, B2, C1, D1, E3 scoring 67 (A2=8, B2=7, C1=0, D1=35, E3=10)\n2) A3, B2, C1, D2, E3 scoring 62 (A3=0, B2=7, C1=0, D2=29, E3=10)\n\nTo foster a deal that could gain the support of all parties while still meeting our minimum score, we should offer slight adjustments utilizing our preferred options. Given that neither of the above fits our preference for A1, we could move on issue A to A1 and offer a compromise on C and E. \n\nTo maintain the Department of Tourism's approval, we should stick with D1.

Balance the need for compensation with the overall viability of the project.\n- Continue to underscore the ecological importance and promote B2 as a balanced approach to address environmental concerns.\n- Remind parties of the overall goal of mutual benefit and the need to secure an agreement suitable for all.\n- Be flexible within these boundaries to ensure the minimum score of 65 is maintained.\n", "\nNext steps:\n- If SportCo insists on issue D, still push for loan D2, but be prepared to compromise possibly up to D1 considering their strong preference for it.\n- Be attentive to the feedback from the Local Labour Union on employment rules and adjust if necessary, while aiming to keep it close to C3 or C4.\n- If pushed on issue E, maintain the argument for reasonable compensation but avoid going lower than E4.\n- Maintain B2 due to the unanimous agreement.\n- Work on finding a middle ground to have some influence on the project through issue A while respecting environmental concerns, sticking to A2.\n- It's essential to continue advocating for a deal that exceeds the 65-point threshold while striving for the highest possible score within the negotiation parameters.\n\n"]}, "finished_rounds": 25}
