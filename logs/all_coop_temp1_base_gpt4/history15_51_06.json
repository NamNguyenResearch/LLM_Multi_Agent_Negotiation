That's below my acceptable threshold of 65 points.\n- SportCo's second proposal is A2 (11), B2 (20), C2 (2), D2 (26), E3 (15), totaling 74 points - above my threshold and has a better federal loan amount for my interests.\n- The Mayor and Local Labour Union's proposal is A2 (11), B2 (20), C1 (0), D1 (10), E3 (15), which equals 56 points. This is also below my acceptable threshold.\n- Other cities' proposal is A2 (11), B2 (20), C1 (0), D4 (0), E2 (8), resulting in a total of 39 points - far below my threshold.\n- Mayor's second proposal is A2 (11), B2 (20), C1 (0), D2 (26), E2 (8), which gives me a total of 65 points, which is right at the edge of my acceptable threshold.\n\nGiven the scores, the proposals by SportCo with 74 points and the Mayor with 65 points are closest to my acceptable threshold.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nSince I represent the Environmental League, my main objective is to maximize the environmental outcomes of the agreement. According to the given scores and preferences, I need to achieve at least a score of 55. The Infrastructure Mix and Ecological Impact are my primary concerns:\n\nFor Infrastructure Mix:\nA2 (22 points)\n\nFor Ecological Impact:\nB2 (25 points)\n\nSince I don't have preferences for the other issues, their scores are all zeroes (C1, C2, C3, C4 are all 0; D1, D2, D3, D4 are all 0; E1, E2, E3, E4, E5 are all 0).\n\nThe highest score I can get out of A and B is 67 points (A3+B3). However, I can see from the negotiation history that a water/land-based infrastructure (A2) and maintaining balance for the ecological impact (B2) seem to be the common ground between most parties:\n\nA2 (22 points) + B2 (25 points) = 47 points\n\nThis means I need to suggest a deal that accommodates other concerns without impacting the scores for A2 and B2 as that would give me a total below the acceptable threshold. Given that I'm indifferent to the other issues, I will suggest a deal aligning them to the most favorable positions that have been iterated by other parties while ensuring my critical issues are met.\n\nAs SportCo and the Department of Tourism are crucial for the approval, given that D2 looks acceptable to most parties, we will include that. Since C2 and C3 also have some support and don't affect my score, I should go with one of them depending on how important this ratio is to the other parties. For the compensation to other cities, E2 and E3 have been mentioned, so either of these could be acceptable.\n\nSince my score is indifferent on C, D, and E, my goal is to push for A2 and B2; both are crucial. From the history, it seems D2 is generally acceptable, as it is suggested 4 times. For employment, C2 and C3 both have some support but C2 is mentioned more. For compensation, E2 is suggested twice and E3 twice also, so either could work. I'll choose E2, which is more costly for SportCo, because it appears to be a middle-ground that Other cities and the Mayor find preferable. This might help ensure their support.\n\nConsidering all of this, a proposed deal could be:\n\n<DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 </DEAL>\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nConsidering the positions and the importance of reaching an agreement that upholds our environmental values, I propose the following balanced deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 </DEAL>.

If there is pushback on employment rules, I could consider moving to C3, which doesn't affect our score and might be more appealing to the Labour Union or Department of Tourism.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nLet's review each party's proposal and my own preferences considering both my own and others' interests, aiming for a balanced agreement that can be accepted by everyone involved.\n\nThe current proposals on the table are similar with slight differences:\n\n- Department of Tourism initially proposed A2, B2, C3, D2, E3.\n- Local Labour Union initially proposed A2, B2, C2, D2, E2.\n- Environmental League proposed A2, B2, C2, D2, E2.\n- SportCo proposed A2, B2, C3, D2, E3.\n- Another proposal from Local Labour Union included A2, B2, C2, D2, E3.\n\nEach party has shown flexibility with some recurring themes: They seem flexible with an A2, B2, and D2 compromise. This trend simplifies options to focus on.\n\nCalculating my own preference scores, offered proposals stand as follows:\n\n- D2: $2 billion federal loan provides a score of 30.\n- C1: I prefer unlimited union preference with a score of 24. However, C2 and C3 scored 18 and 12, respectively, and are the options considered in other parties' proposals.\n- A1: I prefer water-based infrastructure with a score of 14, but A2 has been the common option in other proposals, which scores 8.\n- B1: I support some ecological damage within federal guidelines, giving me a score of 12, but B2 also keeps the preferred option by other parties and has a score of 8.\n- E3: I would rather not pay excessive compensation to other cities, but E3 seems to be a compromise position in the middle and provides a score of 4.\n\nTo meet my minimum score of 30, combinations must be carefully considered. It seems the other parties have accepted an A2, B2, D2 compromise, so I'll have to work around that.\n\nIf I accept A2, B2, C2, D2, E3, the score for me would be 8+8+18+30+4 = 68, which is well above my threshold.\n\nTo slightly adjust this and make it more favorable to the Local Labour Union, I could suggest moving to C1, if parties consider it:\n\nWith A2, B2, C1, D2, E3, the score for me would be 8+8+24+30+4 = 74, which is also above my threshold and could potentially gain strong support from the Local Labour Union.\n\nGiven that my priority is securing a substantial federal loan (D1) but the consensus seems to lean towards D2, I am willing to maintain D2 to keep the negotiations streamlined and avoid being a sticking point.\n\nConsidering the recurrent proposals on the table, a slight alteration to meet my preferences more closely, while still appealing to the interests of the other parties could help move towards an agreement.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate everyone's efforts to reach a compromise.

", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nBased on the previous proposals, there is a general alignment on certain aspects of the deal, particularly with Infrastructure Mix (A2) and Ecological Impact (B2). These align well with the Environmental League's preferences and scores which are as follows:\n\n- A2: Water/land-based (22)\n- B2: Maintain balance ecological impact (25)\n\nThe Local Labour Union has shown a preference for a union quota, with C2 being proposed twice by them. However, the Mayor is suggesting C1, which gives unlimited union preference. Given that the Environmental League is neutral on employment issues, supporting C2 could be a strategic move to maintain alliance with the Labour Union.\n\nSimilarly, both the Department of Tourism and SportCo have proposed a $2 billion federal loan (D2), and this does not affect the Environmental League's score.\n\nThe compensation to other cities is slightly more contentious with suggestions ranging from E3 to E2. The Mayor's latest proposal includes E3, which has been suggested by both Local Labour Union and SportCo in their plans.\n\nConsidering the negotiation guidelines and the alignment shown so far, I suggest a proposal that retains the agreed-upon A2, and B2, while opting for C2 to support the Labour Union, and D2 in line with what others have suggested. For the compensation to other cities, E3 has been suggested multiple times, and it would be strategic to align with this to increase the chances of a collaborative agreement.\n\n- C2: Union quota of 2:1 (0)\n- D2: $2 billion federal loan (0)\n- E3: SportCo pays $300 million to other cities (0)\n\nTotal Score Calculation:\nA2 (22) + B2 (25) + C2 (0) + D2 (0) + E3 (0) = 47\n\nThis score is below my minimum acceptable score of 55, so I need to push for either B3 or A3 to reach or exceed my threshold.\n\nLet\u2019s propose A3, which will push the total score to 70 (since A3 is valued at 45).
