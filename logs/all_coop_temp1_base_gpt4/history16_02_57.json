Assuming B2 gives us 7 points.\n- For employment rules, we could propose C3, which is a middle-ground option and gives us 10 points.\n- We really want a higher federal loan. If we propose D2 instead of D3, it can satisfy \"Department of Tourism\" to a degree while increasing our score significantly. D2 gives us 29 points.\n- For compensation to other cities, offering E3 secures us 10 points and might satisfy their demands to a certain extent.\n\nNew deal score calculation: 8 (A2) + 7 (B2) + 10 (C3) + 29 (D2) + 10 (E3) = 64 points.\n\nThis new deal with a total of 64 points meets our minimum threshold and is more balanced in consideration of the other parties' preferences.

The loan amount from the Department of Tourism is essential (preferably not less than D2), while the labor union's preference is also crucial to us (preferably C1 or C2).

We would prefer A1, but A2 meets a balanced approach.\n- Shift ecological impact to B2, balancing economic and environmental interests and is an intermediate option between B3 and our preferred B1.\n- The federal loan should be no less than D2, as this is critical for the project's sustainability and our preference.\n- Compensations can be set to E2, improving relationships with other cities while not going with the highest compensation.\n\nProposed deal: A2, B2, C2, D2, E2\n\nLet's tally the score for the new proposal.\nNew Proposal (A2, B2, C2, D2, E2) Score:\nA2 (8) + B2 (8) + C2 (18) + D2 (30) + E2 (2) = 66\nThis exceeds our minimum acceptable score and might be more acceptable to other parties based on prior interactions.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into consideration the common goals and the feedback received, I propose a balanced deal that satisfies economic, environmental, and employment objectives, which could be beneficial for all parties: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 </DEAL>.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next round of discussions:\n- If there's pushback on the ecological impact (Issue B), I'll consider advocating for additional environmental projects outside of this scope to guarantee B2 as a compromise.\n- For the federal loan (Issue D), continue insisting on at least D2, but be prepared to discuss additional sources of funding or economic incentives to secure loan agreement.\n- If labour union preference becomes a sticking point (Issue C), discuss potential training or upskilling programs to justify C2.\n- Reassess the compensation strategy (Issue E) and prepare to negotiate possibly going back to E3 if needed to make the deal more enticing to other cities.\n- It's important to keep in mind that our minimum acceptable deal score is 30 and aim for the highest possible score within the collective interests.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nTaking into consideration the common goals and the feedback received, I propose a balanced deal that satisfies economic, environmental, and employment objectives, which could be beneficial for all parties: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 </DEAL>.\n"}, {"agent": "Other cities", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 6 interactions <HISTORY> .
