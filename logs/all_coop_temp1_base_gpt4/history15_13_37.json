Let's start by reviewing the scores:\n\nProposals made:\n\n- Other cities proposed: A2 (8), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (29), E3 (10) -- Total Score = 52\n- SportCo, Department of Tourism, and Local Labour Union agreed to: A2 (8), B2 (7), C2 (5), D2 (29), E3 (10) -- Total Score = 59\n- Mayor proposed: A2 (8), B2 (7), C2 (5), D1 (35), E3 (10) -- Total Score = 65\n- The Environmental League proposed: A2 (8), B3 (0), C2 (5), D2 (29), E3 (10) -- Total Score = 52\n\nNow mapping the respective scores against my preferred outcomes:\n\nD1 (35) is the most preferred option in Issue D, but D2 (29) is also reasonably high.\nE5 (23) is the most preferred option in Issue E, but given the lack of alignment on no compensation, I need to consider offering E2 (5) or E3 (10) to increase the chances of a deal.\nC2 (5) and C3 (10) both have reasonable scores in Issue C, with a slight preference for the latter; however, C2 seems to be acceptable to the union and might be the more strategic choice for consensus.\nA1 (14) would be most ideal in Issue A, but A2 (8) has been tentatively agreed upon by the majority and going with A3 (0) could seriously harm the project and our scoring threshold.\nB1 (11) is most preferred in Issue B, but B2 (7) is closer to a middle ground and has been selected by several parties.\n\nTherefore, I will propose a deal that aligns closely with the Mayor's proposal but adjusting for the compensation to other cities to have a better chance of reaching a unanimous decision and also keeping my minimum threshold in mind:\n\nSuggested deal scores: A2 (8), B2 (7), C2 (5), D1 (35), E3 (10) -- Total Score = 65\n\nThis proposal maintains a higher federal loan which is crucial for our project, accepts the employment quota, and balances the environmental impacts.

As there seems to be a consensus developing around the Ecological impact of B3 and the infrastructure mix of A2, which are not our preferred options but we can live with them, our goal now is to secure the highest possible federal loan (D1) and ensuring local employment which is very important to us (C1 or C2). \n\nConsidering the stance of other cities and their latest proposal, they seek a different compensation, and they are willing to compromise on the federal loan amount which we seek to maximize. Hence, we need to offer them a higher compensation than E3 but lower than E2, to make the other issues more appealing to them. I would aim for E4 as a compromise on this point.\n\nAlso, it seems that the Department of Tourism is concerned with a judicious use of federal funds, we might need to explain the benefits that D1 can bring to ensure the project's potential economic impact.\n\nThe proposal that could potentially satisfy most parties, including us, could be:\nA2 (8), B3 (0), C1 (24), D1 (40), E4 (7) \nThis totals to 79, which is well above our minimum acceptance threshold of 30. This is how we could ensure local employment preferences, our top priority for the federal loan, and still offer a better deal to other cities to sweeten the pot for them.\n\nWe have to ensure that the Department of Tourism and \"SportCo\" approve the deal as they have veto power.
