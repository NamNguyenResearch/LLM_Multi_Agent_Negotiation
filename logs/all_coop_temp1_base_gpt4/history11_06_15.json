The Local Labour Union and Environmental League have both included D1 in their proposals, indicating a potential willingness to accept a high federal loan, which I want to avoid. Additionally, they have included options A2 and A3 which are more acceptable to me than A1, and C3 which suggests a preference for some union jobs but not overwhelming union control.

Since the \"federal loan\" is critical for us, we can give some ground on the \"infrastructure mix\" and \"ecological impact\" while still trying to assert our preference for employment rules and compensation to other cities. \n\nWe need to offer something that (1) will not alienate the Environmental League because we're looking for unanimity and a bonus to our score; (2) will fulfill the Local Labour Union's request for job distribution to union members; (3) will satisfy the Department of Tourism's request for responsible development and fiscal prudence.\n\nA new proposal could look like this:\nA2 - A compromise between our preference and the Department of Tourism and Environmental League's concerns.\nB2 - Adopt enhanced protections for marine life which should be satisfactory for us and preferable for the Environmental League.\nC2 - A compromise on employment in line with what the Department of Tourism and Local Labour Union are suggesting.\nD1 - Our preferred option for the federal loan, as it's critical for the project\u2019s success.\nE4 - A middle ground for compensation that we can live with and might appease 'Other cities' more than E5 without significant loss for us.\n\nThe scores for the proposed deal:\nA2 (8), B2 (7), C2 (5), D1 (35), E4 (15)\nTotal: 8 + 7 + 5 + 35 + 15 = 70 \n\nThis deal matches the highest score we had before but aligns better with others' proposals.
