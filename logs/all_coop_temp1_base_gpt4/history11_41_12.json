", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nBased on the preferences of each party and their proposals, we can make the following assessments and then come up with a proposal that might meet everyone's criteria, including our own:\n\nOur scores for each option are as follows:\nIssue A: A1 (0), A2 (4), A3 (10)\nIssue B: B1 (0), B2 (0), B3 (0) \nIssue C: C1 (12), C2 (8), C3 (6), C4 (0)\nIssue D: D1 (0), D2 (8), D3 (13), D4 (18)\nIssue E: E1 (60), E2 (45), E3 (30), E4 (15), E5 (0)\n\nThe Environmental League is focused on A3 and B2, which indicates their highest priority is the environment. The Department of Tourism is aiming for a responsible investment indicating a preference for a lower federal loan (D3) and some environmental precautions (B2). The Local Labour Union is likely preferring C1 or C2 to ensure a stronger representation of unionized labor, but they are open to C2 given their offer. SportCo has indicated flexibility with A2, C4, and prefers high federal loan and lower compensation to other cities.\n\nWhile we have no direct preference on the ecological impact (Issue B), it seems that most other parties, except for SportCo, are favoring B2, which includes special precautions for local wildlife.\n\nFor the infrastructure mix (Issue A), while we prefer A3 and SportCo initially proposed A1, there seems to be a trend towards A2, which is a middle ground we can accept (with a score of 4).\n\nFor the employment rules (Issue C), the Local Labour Union doesn't want C4, and they align with us on higher union preference. Thus, our preferred C1 might be too ambitious, but C2 would be an acceptable compromise for us.\n\nIssue D involves federal funding. We prefer less funding (ideally D4), but given the need for a compromise, D3 appears to be more acceptable by other parties, and it is the next best option for us.\n\nFinally, for the compensation to other cities (Issue E), we need a high value, with a strong preference for E1, yet we notice that SportCo has proposed E5 in their initial offer, which is unacceptable. Others proposed E3 which we can live with if we can balance the other issues in our favor.\n\nTaking into account all of the above considerations, we propose a combination that balances each party's preferences and fulfills our minimum score requirement. \n\nProposed combination: \nA2 (4), B2 (0), C2 (8), D3 (13), E2 (45)\n\nThis gives us a total score of 70, which is above our minimum threshold of 31. This proposal also balances the interests while retaining a reasonable compensation for us without putting undue financial stress on the Department of Tourism.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nAfter considering everyone's interests and the need for a balanced approach, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>. This takes into account environmental concerns, fair employment opportunities, responsible spending, and just compensation to other cities.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nIn the next round of negotiations, based on the response to my current proposal, I must be ready to explore the following options:\n\n- Be willing to go down to E3 if needed, but explore possibilities to balance this concession with gains in Issue C (perhaps push harder for C1) or Issue A (push for A3).\n- If pushback is received on Issue C (employment rules), be ready to further negotiate within the range of C2 to C3, acknowledging the position of the Local Labour Union.\n- If there is a strong opposition to the proposed compensation (Issue E), assert the importance of this issue for us as \"other cities\" to ensure we find suitable middle ground.\n- Stay firm on wanting less federal funding (Issue D), as this impacts potential future investments in our cities. If D3 is not accepted, do not go beyond D2, to keep the Department of Tourism's funding availability in check.\n- Reiterate no particular preference for the ecological impact aspect (Issue B), letting the Environmental League lead on this front, but make it clear that B3 (improve) might require additional compromises in other areas.\n- Keep in mind the need for a deal that SportCo and the Department of Tourism can accept since their approval is crucial.\n\nIt's important to remain adaptable and look for trade-offs in areas that are less critical to us without dropping below our minimum threshold score.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nAfter considering everyone's interests and the need for a balanced approach, I propose the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>.

This is below our minimum threshold.\n\nOur deal (A2, B2, C2, D3, E2) scores as follows:\n- A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C2 (8) + D3 (13) + E2 (45) = 70. This is significantly above our threshold.\n\nMayor\u2019s first deal (A2, B2, C1, D1, E3) scores as follows:\n- A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C1 (12) + D1 (0) + E3 (30) = 46. This is above our minimum threshold but not ideal.\n\nDepartment of Tourism\u2019s deal (A2, B2, C3, D2, E3) scores as follows:\n- A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C3 (6) + D2 (8) + E3 (30) = 48. This is above our minimum threshold but not ideal.\n\nMayor\u2019s second deal (A2, B2, C1, D1, E4) scores as follows:\n- A2 (4) + B2 (0) + C1 (12) + D1 (0) + E4 (15) = 31. This meets the minimum threshold exactly, but gives us no room for negotiation.\n\nThe Local Labour Union has endorsed the Mayor's second deal, so we must assume C1 is very important for them.\n\nIt is clear that issue E (compensation) is our highest priority, and we want this to be as high as possible, closely followed by the issue D. Issues A and C are also important but to a lesser degree, and we have no preference on issue B (which is a potential area for compromising).\n\nGiven the need for endorsements from SportCo and the Department of Tourism, we need to consider their financial interests (issue D). We must also respect the union preferences to earn the support of the Local Labour Union (issue C). A2 is a common ground on the infrastructure issue now.\n\nConsidering all this information and striving for a balanced deal, we might propose the following:\n- Keep A2, seemingly agreed upon by all parties.\n- B2, as there is no preference from our side and it's important for the Environmental League.\n- C1 or C2, depending on how important it is for the Union and balancing it against compensations in E.\n- D2 or D3 to demonstrate our flexibility to SportCo and the Department of Tourism.\n- E2 would be ideal for us, but given the support for E3 and E4, we may have to settle for E3, balance it by pushing for C1, and consider counterbalancing this with D3 instead of D2.\n\nWe should start with a combination that has high scoring potential for us but also incorporates some of the preferences of the other parties.\n\nLet's consider proposing:\n- A2 (4 points)\n- B2 (0 points)\n- C1 (12 points)\n- D3 (13 points)\n- E3 (30 points)\n\nThis proposal would sum to a total score for us of 59, which is high.

While SportCo initially advocates for A1 and B1, it is critical to negotiate towards a more land-based infrastructure and at least maintaining the balance of the local dolphin and sea lion populations.\n\nI will suggest issue B be at B2 because B3 seems too high for what other parties have suggested so far, but I can't go lower than B2 to meet my score requirement. A3 is my target for the infrastructure, but considering other parties' positions, I might have to accept A2 for now.\n\nBased on previous interactions, C1 seems to be favored by SportCo and the Local Labour Union, any C option does not affect my score. Given this and focusing on my critical issues (A and B), I can be flexible on the C issue.\n\nFor Issue D, the Department of Tourism seems to be flexible between D1 and D2. I'm indifferent to this, so I will follow their preference for compromise.\n\nIssue E (Compensation to Other Cities) does not affect my score either. I need to be flexible here and can go as low as what's been generally accepted, E3 or E4.\n\nI propose a deal that would be the most environmentally friendly while still securing support from other parties:\n\nNew Proposal Calculation: A2 (22), B2 (25), C1 (0), D2 (0), E4 (0)\nTotal Score = 22 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 47\n\nMy new proposal still doesn't meet my 55 score threshold, so I need to push for A3.\n\nNew Proposal with A3: A3 (45), B2 (25), C1 (0), D2 (0), E4 (0)\nTotal Score = 45 + 25 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 70\n\nThis new deal achieves a score above my minimum threshold.

The federal loan amount (D) seems to be the area where there's room for compromise.\n\nThe combination I am considering would be: A2 (20), B2 (0), C1 (42), D2 (20), E4 (8) which adds up to a total of 90.
