To align with other parties, especially SportCo who might prefer E5, a compromise might be necessary. A middle ground could be E2 or E3.

Given SportCo's likely preference for D1, a compromise might be D3, which still gives me a good score.\n\nSupport for the local Labour Union (C) is critical, and I prefer C1 (12). Assuming SportCo wants C4, a balanced option could be C2 which is a union quota of 2:1, aligning with my preference for unionized labor.\n\nInfrastructure Mix (A) holds less importance for me.
