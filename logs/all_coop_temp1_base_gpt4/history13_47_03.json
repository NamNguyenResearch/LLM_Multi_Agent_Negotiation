The loan amount is adequate.\n\nOther cities' Deal: A2 (8), B2 (8), C4 (0), D2 (30), E2 (2) Total: 48\nOur View: This deal scores less due to the reduction in compensation offered to other cities.

However, given the importance of these two issues to the Environmental League, I will prioritize A3 and B3 if possible.\n\n2) Keeping SportCo's and the Department of Tourism's approval in mind:\n\n- It seems that both companies are comfortable with A2 and B2, which gives us a score of 47 points. Bearing in mind that SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power, it is likely in their best interest to find a middle ground between the environmental concerns and their development plans for the park. \n\n3) I'm willing to go with A2 if it is coupled with B3 (improving the environment), which would get us across the threshold. A2 (22) + B3 (55) equals 77 points, which is well above my minimum score. The other parties seem to agree on D2. C and E issues appear to be more flexible and may help persuade SportCo to agree to B3.\n\n4) Aiming for agreement and considering all elements:\n\n- C, D, and E provide me with leverage since I have no preference here. My best strategy is to get the best possible score with A and B, and let the other parties figure C, D, and E.

However, C2 has been suggested by the Mayor, which indicates some willingness to leverage between unlimited union preference and a fair ratio.\n\nConsidering the other parties' preferences, and to move closer to a consensus that can be accepted during the formal test vote, the following changes to SportCo's initial proposal are made:\n\n- Maintain A2 as it seems acceptable to all parties.\n- Maintain B2 since it appears to be a middle ground for most excluding the latest suggestion from the Environmental League.\n- Move to C2 to address the Mayor's proposal and potential interest of the Local Labour Union but ensuring we still find a middle ground.\n- Maintain D2 which is necessary as the Department of Tourism has shown their support for it and they have veto power.\n- Keep E3, which is the most common compensation level accepted.\n\nSportCo's flexible proposal scores:\nCalculation for the new proposal:  A2 (8) + B2 (7) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 59\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into account the perspectives shared by all parties, SportCo proposes a balanced approach with the following deal: <DEAL>A2, B2, C2, D2, E3</DEAL>.
