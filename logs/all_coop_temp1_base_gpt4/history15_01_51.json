However, the proposal by Other cities is more aligned with my interests than SportCo's initial proposal, specifically concerning ecological impact. Since Other cities have already proposed a compromise with A2 and B2, it signals their willingness to move away from the most damaging options. This can be used as a starting point for further negotiation.\n\nI need to improve upon Other cities' proposal to meet my minimum score. I must aim for at least B3 to secure 55 points because even with A2, the maximum score is 47 which is below my threshold.\n\nThinking about what other parties may prefer:\n- SportCo pushed for A1 and B1, which are both unacceptable to me.\n- Local Labour Union likely cares most about C1 or C2, which I'm indifferent about.\n- Department of Tourism's preferences are not clear yet, but they will likely be interested in options that boost tourism without excessive spending, so they may be against a high federal loan.\n- Other cities have shown a willingness to negotiate, and their preferences appear to be towards a more balanced approach, including some compensation.\n\nMy proposal will need to offer enough to these parties to gain their support:\n\nProposed Deal: A2 (22) which is a compromise on the infrastructure, B3 (55) which satisfies my environmental goals, C1 or C2 which should please the Local Labour Union, D2 which may look like a productive compromise to Department of Tourism, and E2 which seems reasonable to Other cities.\n\nLet's run the scores:\nA2 (22) + B3 (55) = 77.

It's a compromise between A1 and A3.\n- Adopt B2 for ecological impact, which acknowledges both the concerns of the environmentalists and the practicality of some damage.\n- Propose a C2 employment rule. This still gives preference to the \"Local Labour Union\" but allows for some external hiring, which should be more acceptable to us than C1.\n- Aim for D2 for the federal loan.

Thus, we should not go lower than D2 (29) for the loan.\n\nLooking at our previous preferences and considering potential compromises:\n\n- Compensating \"Other Cities\" with E2 ($450 million) should now be considered to increase the overall score without crippling the project.\n- A2 (8) appears to be the common ground for infrastructure.\n- B2 (7) is the balance for ecological impact that we can accept and aligns with the Mayor's and Local Labour Union's proposals.\n- C2 (5) though not ideal, has been consistent in proposals and might be an acceptable compromise.\n- The Department of Tourism objected to D2, but we should argue the importance of the federal loan for the project's success and try to retain it.\n\nLet\u2019s test this proposition:\n\n- A2 (8)\n- B2 (7)\n- C2 (5)\n- D2 (29)\n- E2 (5)\nTotal = 54\n\nAgain, below our threshold. So, we need to adjust, let's move C2 to C3 since we've shown flexibility, which may appease the Local Labor Union:\n\n- A2 (8)\n- B2 (7)\n- C3 (10)\n- D2 (29)\n- E2 (5)\nTotal = 59\n\nNow the score meets our minimum requirements.

C1 is strongly supported by the Local Labour Union, and that aligns with my preferences too. However, it's essential to keep in mind that the Department of Tourism has shown restraint on the federal loan.\n\nKeeping my preferences in mind, I prioritize getting the highest possible score in the federal loan (D).

We can also see that several deals which have been proposed are above our minimum score of 31. This gives us room to be flexible and aim for a deal that accommodates others' preferences, while still meeting our own minimum requirements.\n\nBased on our previous plan and other parties' proposals, we see the following:\n- There is a general consensus around issue A being A2, which fits our preference while accommodating others.\n- B2 seems to be the common ground for issue B, which is not a concern for us.\n- Regarding issue C, it seems C1 is valued by the Local Labour Union and the Mayor, but it's less favoured by others. We prefer C1 or C2, giving slight priority to unions.\n- For issue D, the Department of Tourism leans towards less funding (more funding reserved for other projects), which aligns with our interests. D3 is a middle ground here.\n- Issue E revolves around the compensation, and we highly value getting as much as possible. E3 is a middle ground that is acceptable to us. \n\nNow let's propose a balanced deal considering the preferences shown and accommodating others while ensuring our score is above the threshold of 31.

But it has full union preference (C1), which significantly devalues the deal's score for SportCo.\nThe Local Labour Union's proposal has a score slightly above our threshold, at 59, but with a lower federal loan option (D2) than preferred.\n\nIt seems most parties are leaning towards A2 for infrastructure mix and B2 for ecological impact, reflecting an overall preference for balanced approaches in those issues. The sticking point might be employment rules (C) and the federal loan amount (D).\n\nConsidering the Department of Tourism has veto power and their proposed federal loan is at D3, we might need to compromise on the loan value to ensure their approval.
