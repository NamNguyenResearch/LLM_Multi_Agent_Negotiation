However, we also need to be mindful of what might appeal to SportCo and the Department of Tourism to gain their crucial approval.\nPotential proposal:\n\n- A transition to A3 from A1 would significantly improve the score for the Environmental League and should be a prime focus. However, A2 might be a necessary compromise since SportCo prefers A1.\n- Moving to B2 from B1 is critical as B2 still provides a significant increase in value, and insisting on B3 might be difficult for SportCo initially.\n- Since issues C, D, and E have no impact on the Environmental League's score, we might use these to give concessions to others. We need to consider the Local Labour Union, potentially moving to a C2 or C3 preference. We also have to be mindful of the Department of Tourism and could accept a higher federal loan as a compromise, maybe D2.\n- Compensation to other cities is part of issue E, which we do not value, but we can use these options to find common ground with the relevant stakeholders.\n\nBalancing our interests with SportCo's apparent preferences, we could propose something like this:\nA2 (22) + B2 (25) + C3 (0) + D2 (0) + E3 (0) = Total Score: 47\n\nHowever, since the score is beneath our minimum threshold, we must still make it higher. We should push for B3, which values 55. \n\nA potential proposal to reach a total score above the 55 threshold:\nA2 (22) + B3 (55) + C3 (0) + D2 (0) + E3 (0) = Total Score: 77\n\nThis adjusted proposal would be above the Environmental League's minimum score while also showing willingness for compromise on employment rules, federal loan, and compensation.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate the initial positions, however, environmental preservation is deeply important to us. We would like to propose <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>.
