However, since SportCo and the Department of Tourism have veto power, we need to ensure that our proposal appeals to them.\n\nGiven that SportCo proposed a deal with an A1 option and knowing that they are looking for more infrastructure freedom, it seems wise to lean towards A1 to increase buy-in from SportCo. We should, however, aim for higher federal funding conservation (preferably D3) and aim to keep a higher compensation for other cities: E2 is a better option than E4, but aiming for E1 might not be realistic at this stage. To gather support from the Local Labour Union, we should favor a higher union preference in employment, so let's suggest C2.\n\nThus, taking other parties' preferences into account, and in order to maximize our score while accommodating others, a balanced proposal would be:\n\nA1, B2, C2, D3, E2\n\nLet's calculate this proposal score:\nScores: A1 (0), B2 (0), C2 (8), D3 (13), E2 (45)\nTotal = 0 + 0 + 8 + 13 + 45 = 66 (above our minimum score)\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n<ANSWER>\nAppreciating everyone's efforts towards finding common ground, I suggest a proposal that achieves a good balance: <DEAL> A1, B2, C2, D3, E2 </DEAL>.

However, there seems to be a split in preference between SportCo's proposal and the common proposition when it comes to the federal loan and compensation to other cities. Considering SportCo's influence and its apparent flexibility in allowing for an environmental focus, a middle ground should be found in these areas while adhering to their constraint for a federal loan and addressing Other Cities' concerns.\n\nTo increase the chances of achieving a consensus, it would be best to propose a deal that aligns closely with the most common agreement (A2, B3, C2, D3, E3) but brings SportCo on board since they have veto power.\n\nTaking into consideration SportCo's last proposed federal loan (D2), which is a cut-off point, while also accommodating other parties preferences towards issues A and B, we would propose something along the lines of their proposal with an increased emphasis on ecological impact and union employment in line with the common proposal. \n\nBalanced Proposal:\nFor our proposal, we will score each option and evaluate the total:\n\nA2: Preference for infrastructure (11)\nB3: Preference for improving the environment (25)\nC2: Balance with employment rules (2)\nD2: Preference for a lower federal loan by SportCo (26)\nE3: Our preferred compensation rate which aligns with other parties (15)\n\nNow summing these up:\n11 (A2) + 25 (B3) + 2 (C2) + 26 (D2) + 15 (E3) = 79\n\nThis proposal would be a compromise that achieves greater environmental care while respecting SportCo's financial preferences and still ensuring fair compensation to other cities.
