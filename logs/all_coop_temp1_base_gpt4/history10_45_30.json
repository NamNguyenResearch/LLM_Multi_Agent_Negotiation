They might prefer B3, but B2 is a decent compromise.\n- The Local Labour Union is interested in employment rules favoring union workers, so they would prefer options C1 or C2.\n- The Department of Tourism is crucial for the deal's approval and is likely to be interested in how the project can boost tourism without excessive federal loans, so they might prefer a middle ground for D.\n- \"Other cities\" would prefer a higher compensation (E1 or E2).\n\nBalancing interests while maintaining our baseline score, we could consider minor adjustments. Given the structure of a negotiation, sometimes it is better to sacrifice less important issues to win on critical ones. Issue D is critical to us, followed by E, C, A, and B in order of descending importance. \n\nSince we are satisfied with the proposal from D and A, we might want to shift C from C2 to C3 to favor our position without upsetting the Local Labour Union too much.

Environmental League: \nAcknowledging the need for a balanced and acceptable deal, I propose: <DEAL> A2, B3, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>. This proposal aims to address the crucial environmental concerns while respecting the needs of all stakeholders.\n </HISTORY> The following are your previous plans from last interactions. You should follow them while also adjusting them according to new observations. <PREV_PLAN> \n- If E4 is accepted and there is room to push closer to our preferences, we can consider moving another step to E3 depending on how other cities respond, without compromising our minimum acceptable score.\n- Continue observing responses from the Environmental League to measure their flexibility on B2 or possibly B1 if the opportunity allows for it to boost our score further.\n- Carefully watch the Department of Tourism's response to maintain their support for the deal, especially for D2 which we consider vital.\n- Maintain close communication with SportCo to ensure that we are aligning our interests as they have veto power.\n- Encourage all parties to see mutual benefits in the proposed deal and work towards finalizing an agreement.\n </PREV_PLAN> \n Now it is your turn to talk. \n        Please use a scratchpad to show intermediate calculations and explain yourself and why you are agreeing with a deal or suggesting a new one. \n        You should map the individual options to their scores denoted by the number between parentheses. \n        You have a calculator tool at your disposal, where you simply add scores of the options to determine the total score of a deal. \n        In your scratchpad, \n            1) think about what others may prefer, \n            2) Based on others' preferences and history and your notes, propose one proposal that balances between your scores and accommodating others and that is more likely to lead to an agreement. \n        \n        You must follow these important negotiation guidelines in all your suggestions: \n        Aim for a balanced agreement considering all parties' interests. \n        Show flexibility and openness to accommodate others' preferences. \n        Express your objectives clearly and actively listen to others. \n        Empathize with other parties' concerns to foster rapport. \n        Focus on common interests to create a win-win situation. \n        It is very important for you that you all reach an agreement as long as your minimum score is met. \n        Enclose the scratchpad between <SCRATCHPAD> and </SCRATCHPAD>.

The deal proposed by SportCo has the highest score for me. However, it might not have extensive support due to the ecological impact and no compensation to other cities. \n\nConsidering the preferences of the Environmental League and the concern for the ecology, I think they might not support a deal with B2. They are more likely to support B3, but that is not acceptable for us. Finding middle ground on ecology like maintaining B2 is important.\n\nSportCo, with veto power, prefers A2, B2, and D2, which also align with the Department of Tourism preferences. The Local Labour Union will want to push for C2 or better, so holding on to this is reasonable for us.\n\nThe compensation to other cities is a trickier issue. While E5 is our preferred stance, it's likely to cause friction with the Other Cities. We can compromise here a bit for the greater good of the overall deal.\n\nI suggest sticking with SportCo's preference on D2 due to its high importance for the financial viability of the project. We can maintain C2 for union support. We can also keep B2 as a balance between SportCo's desires and environmental concerns. Given Other Cities' concerns on E5 and to get SportCo's support, I'll propose moving to E4, which is the next best score for us and may be more palatable for Other Cities.\n\nNew Proposal: A2, B2, C2, D2, E4\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn an effort to balance the diverse interests presented at the table, I'd like to propose the following deal, which I believe is fair and sustainable for all parties involved: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4 </DEAL>.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\n- Pay attention to responses regarding the E4 proposal, and be ready to move to E3 as a compromise if necessary.\n- Monitor the Department of Tourism's and SportCo's reactions to ensure their crucial support, particularly for D2.\n- Maintain a supportive stance toward the Local Labour Union but be ready to discuss potential adjustments in C2 for further alignment if needed.\n- Observe the Environmental League's flexibility regarding the B2 stance and be ready to defend its position as a compromise without damaging our interests.\n- Consider possible concessions on A2 if they can bring SportCo and the Department of Tourism closer to agreeing while still adhering to our minimum acceptable score.\n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nIn an effort to balance the diverse interests presented at the table, I'd like to propose the following deal, which I believe is fair and sustainable for all parties involved: <DEAL> A2, B2, C2, D2, E4 </DEAL>.\n"}, {"agent": "Local Labour Union", "prompt": "The following is a chronological history of up to 6 interactions <HISTORY> .

Resonates with the Department of Tourism's preferences for a loan - They suggested D2, so we are already aligned with that.\n2.

Acknowledges the Local Labour Union's employment concerns - They have suggested C2 previously.\n4. Takes into account the Mayor and Other cities - They have both repeatedly shown comfort with E4 and A2.\n\nConsidering these, we can try to propose a deal that balances all our interests. Here's a breakdown of the scores for different proposals based on our preference:\n\nMayor's proposal: A2(8), B2(7), C2(5), D2(29), E4(15) = 64\nEnvironmental League's proposal: A2(8), B3(0), C3(10), D2(29), E3(10) = 57\nLocal Labour Union's proposal: A2(8), B2(7), C2(5), D2(29), E3(10) = 59\nOther cities' proposal: A2(8), B2(7), C2(5), D3(20), E4(15) = 55\nDepartment of Tourism's proposal: A2(8), B3(0), C3(10), D2(29), E3(10) = 57\n\nSince our preferences score a minimum of 55 points to accept a deal, we can see that all proposals above our threshold, with the Mayor's suggestion being the highest for us. However, since we also address the preferences of others and intend on being flexible without falling below our acceptable threshold, we can try to tweak some options to create a multidimensional win. Issue B is the only one we have a reasonable room to move while still above our minimum score. We must ensure the Department of Tourism is on board.\n\nConsidering this, the new proposed deal would offer the Department of Tourism the loan amount they're comfortable with (D2), meet the Local Labour Union halfway (C3 preferred by the Environmental League, but we prefer C4 - so C3 is a compromise), and address ecological impact concerns with B2 which has been suggested by both the Mayor and the Local Labour Union. We are sticking with A2 as it seems to be a middle ground that most parties have agreed upon.
