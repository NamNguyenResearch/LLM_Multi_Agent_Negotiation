", "full_answer": "<SCRATCHPAD>\nFirst, let\u2019s evaluate the deal that \"Other cities\" has proposed and see how it scores according to SportCo's preferences:\n\nA2 (Water/land-based): 8\nB1 (Some damage): 11\nC2 (Union quota of 2:1): 5\nD3 ($1 billion loan): 20\nE2 (SportCo pays $450 million to \"Other cities\"): 5\n\nAdding these up: 8 + 11 + 5 + 20 + 5 = 49. This deal does not meet SportCo's minimum threshold of 55 points.\n\nSportCo's initial proposal (A1, B1, C4, D1, E5) scores:\nA1: 14\nB1: 11\nC4: 17\nD1: 35\nE5: 23\nTotal Score = 100\n\nWith the Department of Tourism having veto power, it's crucial to propose a deal that is attractive to them. They are likely interested in ensuring the project attracts tourism and is financially sustainable. Therefore, SportCo needs to propose something closer to D1 for the federal loan. A high loan will signal a significant investment in local tourism and economic development, which should appeal to the Department. However, to keep negotiations going, some compromises might be necessary.\n\nGiven our need to compromise and the criticality of the federal loan, we can be more flexible on Issue E (compensation to other cities) but still aim for a lower amount as it holds the least priority score. For Issue A, as SportCo prefers water-based facilities for flexibility, SportCo can aim for an A2 as a compromise since A1 may be too challenging to negotiate. For the Union preference (Issue C), we can aim for a more middling position since it is not as important as the federal loan. And since SportCo least wants to impact the ecosystem, B1 should stay as is since SportCo believes it is inevitable but will remain within federal guidelines.\n\nNow, considering the importance of the federal loan and the strong reluctance to compensate other cities, here's a potential deal that compromises on some issues but ensures SportCo's minimum threshold is met:\n\nA2: This compromise can show flexibility towards the environmental concerns and other parties' desires, especially the Environmental League.\nB1: Maintaining this ensures federal guidelines are met, which should appease both Environmental League concerns and meet federal loan criteria.\nC3: A more balanced union approach can appeal to the Local Labour Union and may not displease other potential employees greatly.\nD2: A lower federal loan than initially wanted but still significant to showcase commitment to the project.\nE3: Offering some compensation, albeit lower than initially proposed by Other cities, displays a willingness to compromise.\n\nLet's calculate this proposed deal\u2019s score:\n\nA2 (8) + B1 (11) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 68\n\nThis deal scores above the minimum threshold of 55 points.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn the spirit of compromise and considering all stakeholder interests, SportCo proposes the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B1, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>. This proposal balances SportCo's vision and flexibility with a commitment to local economic, environmental, and community benefits.\n</ANSWER>\n\n<PLAN>\nFor the next round of negotiations, consider further adjustments on:\n\n- Employment rules (Issue C): Continue discussing the union ratio to ensure the most acceptable employment terms.\n- Infrastructure mix (Issue A): See if further flexibility is viable or a deal-breaker as water-based development might be a major concern for the Environmental League.\n- Ecological impact (Issue B): Keep as is due to the commitment to federal guidelines and relatively lower priority.\n- Compensation to Other Cities (Issue E): Be open to negotiating a lower compensation if necessary to meet other higher-priority goals, especially if Other Cities strongly insist on compensation.\n- Federal Loan (Issue D): Stand firm on D2 unless the Department of Tourism requires a different stance to approve the deal. \n</PLAN>", "public_answer": "\nIn the spirit of compromise and considering all stakeholder interests, SportCo proposes the following deal: <DEAL> A2, B1, C3, D2, E3 </DEAL>.

However, it seems that SportCo is somewhat flexible with infrastructure mix, employment rules, and compensation to other cities. Also, we see that they already moved from a water-based infrastructure (A1) to a water/land-based (A2), from no union preference (C4) to a 1:1 ratio (C3), and they asked for less loan money (D2 instead of D1) and agreed on compensation (E3 instead of E5).

It's also clear that the Department of Tourism prefers a higher level of environmental protection (B3), while the Environmental League prefers B3 with no concessions on C4 from the latest round. Given that B2 is acceptable to me (and better than B1 for the Environmental League and DoT), I should consider leaning towards it instead of insisting on B1.\n\nWhile I prioritize financial support through the federal loan, it looks like reaching an agreement on D2 instead of D1 is more plausible since multiple parties have proposed it or similar.\n\nConsidering the importance of the Local Labour Union's support to me, I'd prefer an employment rule that favors the union (C2), which has been suggested by both my previous proposal and that of the Local Labour Union.\n\nFor the compensation to other cities, I'm relatively flexible, but I want to lean towards E3 to maintain good relationships, even though I'd prefer less compensation (E4 or E5).\n\nNow, considering others' proposals and positions, I need to find a middle ground that would likely be agreeable to all parties and meets my minimum score. Since the DoT values the environment but is flexible with the loan amount, and SportCo is open to B2, I will keep B2. I will keep A2, as that was suggested by all parties and is still acceptable to me. For C, I will aim for C2 which is a middle ground and preferred by me and the Union.
