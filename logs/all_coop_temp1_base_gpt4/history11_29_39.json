But we can trade off in other areas for a better score while still appealing to SportCo. Also, we need to improve Environmentally League's score as they'd prefer B3.\n\nRevised proposal considerations based on scoring preferences and assumptions of others:\n- A2 (water/land-based): 11 points, a preferable compromise for environmental concerns and development diversity.\n- B2 (maintain balance): 20 points, satisfies environmental concerns without demanding improvement and still protects local wildlife.\n- C3 (union quota of 1:1): 4 points, it keeps balance and shows neutral stance towards the local labour union.\n- D1 ($3 billion federal loan): 10 points, SportCo favors this, and I may need to compromise here.\n- E3 (SportCo pays $300 million to other cities): 15 points, it's a fair compensation to other cities, and aligns with my preference. \n\nCalculating the score of the revised proposal:\n11 (A2) + 20 (B2) + 4 (C3) + 10 (D1) + 15 (E3) = 60 points.\n\nThis proposal is still below the minimum score threshold. I would need to push for a less expensive loan arrangement or more favorable environmental option:\n\nIdeal proposal to exceed the minimum score while balancing interests:\n- A2 (water/land-based): this is my most preferred option.\n- B3 (improve): should fully satisfy Environmental League.\n- C4 (no Union preference): while it favors my stance, I am open to C3 as a compromise.\n- D2 ($2 billion federal loan): this increases my score dramatically while still showing a significant investment.\n- E3 (SportCo pays $300 million to other cities): this matches with my preference.\n\nCalculating the ideal proposal score:\n11 (A2) + 25 (B3) + 9 (C4) + 26 (D2) + 15 (E3) = 86 points.\n\nThis exceeds my minimum and proposes a balanced agreement considering other parties' likely interests.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate SportCo's initial proposal, but I'd suggest a few adjustments to balance development and environmental concerns while considering the economic aspects for all parties involved.

However, my priority is to maximize compensation while also being mindful of the federal loan which directly impacts future projects in the other cities I represent.\n\nConsidering the deals proposed by other parties, we can try to infer their preferences:\n\n- SportCo's initial proposal likely seeks maximum development freedom and minimum financial obligation (A1, E5). However, they've shown willingness to adapt by offering a compromise including options A2, B2, C3.\n  \n- The Department of Tourism prefers a deal with a lower federal loan (D2) and higher environmental consideration (B3).\n  \n- The Local Labour Union is highly interested in maximizing employment opportunities for their members, hence their preference for C1.\n  \n- The Environmental League shares similar interests with the Department of Tourism when it comes to the environment (B3) and likely supports more job security for local employees.\n\nA proposal that would seem balanced to me while improving my score would be:\n\nA2 (4) - It's been generally supported and aligns with others' suggestions except SportCo's initial proposal, still a mid-ground.\nB3 (0) - I have no score preference, so I'll agree with the Department of Tourism and Environmental League to foster goodwill.\nC1 (12) - This aligns with the Labour Union's preference and gets me maximum score on labour preference.\nD3 (13) - This would be a lower loan than D2, satisfying my preference and possibly leaving more funding for my city's future projects. We haven't seen a steong opposition to it thus far.\nE2 (45) - This increases the amount of compensation substantially from the current SportCo proposal, meeting one of my main interests.\n\nNew deal score = 4 + 0 + 12 + 13 + 45 = 74\n\nThis new proposal scores well above my acceptance threshold and should be appealing to the Department of Tourism and the Local Labour Union, who have been showing flexible positions.

Although B1 is our preference for 11 points, all parties are leaning towards B3.\n\nC2 (Union quota of 2:1) is repeatedly supported and seems to be the middle ground on the employment issue, garnering us 5 points, albeit not our preferred option.\n\nD, the federal loan, finds middle ground at D2 ($2 billion) in most proposals. This is also our second-best option, giving us 29 points and is quite critical.\n\nFor E, it seems we have a stance favoring no compensation (E5 for 23 points), but from the discussion, the preference of other parties lies between E2 and E4 (giving us between 5 and 15 points).\n\nCalculating the potential deal's score:\n- A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E4 (15) = 57 points\nThis is above our acceptable threshold of 55 points.\n\nLooking at the history, to move things forward and find a balance based on the interests of other parties while respecting our own thresholds, I suggest considering E3, which is a midway compromise that other cities might be more amenable to compared to E4, as it was considered by Department of Tourism and received support from the Local Labour Union.\n\nAdjusting the entire deal to include the more acceptable compensation to other cities but maintaining the federal loan that is pivotal to us, the new proposal could be:\n- A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C2 (5) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 52 points\n\nHowever, this falls below our threshold. To bump it above our minimum score, we could shift to C3 (Union quota of 1:1), which hasn't been discussed much, but could be a reasonable compromise to labor, yielding us 10 points.\n\nThe amended deal would be:\n- A2 (8) + B3 (0) + C3 (10) + D2 (29) + E3 (10) = 57 points, which is exactly the total score from the proposal with E4, and is above our cut-off threshold.\n\nSince it's essential for us to find an agreement and this proposal still keeps us above the threshold, we should consider offering this as the next step in negotiations.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nIn an effort to respect the positions of all stakeholders, especially those related to environmental and labor concerns, and considering the need for a balanced financial approach, I propose the following: <DEAL>A2, B3, C3, D2, E3</DEAL>.

The Department of Tourism proposed C3, which points towards a preference for a balanced approach towards employment. As for federal loans, preferences vary between D2 and D3, but considering my neutrality, I can accommodate either.\n\nSo, to strike a balance considering everyone's preferences and to be most likely to reach an agreement, the following proposal seems viable:\n\n- Maintain B3 as it's agreed upon by all parties and scores the highest for the Environment League.\n- Choose A2 as it is the median position that aligns with the majority of parties.\n- Accommodate the preference of C3 which seems acceptable to the significant stakeholders, including the Department of Tourism, which has veto power.\n- Propose a middle ground for the Federal Loan with D3, which has been preferred by a couple of parties and does not affect my score.\n- Offer E3 for compensation which seems reasonable compensation to cover the concerns of Other Cities and has been proposed by multiple parties.\n\nThis yields an acceptable deal within my scorecard and appears to align with others' interests.\n\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nI appreciate the thoughtful considerations presented by all parties.

I need to adjust the proposal to better meet my preferences without dropping the score below 30 and while considering the preferences of other parties.\n\nA possible compromise could be to push for a higher federal loan (D2) and a more favorable position on employment rules (C2), as these are high priority issues for me and can potentially be more agreeable to the other parties.\n\nLet's calculate this new potential deal:\nProposed New Deal: A2, B3, C2, D2, E3\n\nIssue A: A2 (8)\nIssue B: B3 (0)\nIssue C: C2 (18)\nIssue D: D2 (30)\nIssue E: E3 (4)\n\nTotal Score: 8 + 0 + 18 + 30 + 4 = 60\n\nThis score is still above my minimum acceptable score and improves the scores on my high priority issues.

Issue D has more flexibility, and it seems like a score for E3 is feasible and likely to gain support from the others. \n\nNow, to create a proposal that is likely to be accepted, takes into account the interests of the parties and still meets my minimum score:\n\nEvaluating the Environmental League and the Department of Tourism's willingness to go for D3, and the Mayor's and Labour Union's bend towards D2, a middle ground of D3 favors my interests without moving entirely towards D4. \nSince everyone has agreed on B3, we can keep that constant.\nThe Local Labour Union and the Mayor favor C2. SportCo and the Environmental League indicated they could go for C3, but there's a chance they might agree to C2, knowing it's closer to the Labour Union's preference and it is also something you initially proposed.\nE2 seems vital to keep the score above my minimum threshold. Lowering to E3, as many have suggested, drops the score but remains above the threshold.\n\nLet's try with E2 and see if that's agreeable:\n\nProposed Deal:\nA2 (4) + B3 (0) + C2 (8) + D3 (13) + E2 (45) = Total Score: 70\n\nThis deal maintains the initial total score I aimed for, while showing openness to the others' preferences in terms of federal loans.
