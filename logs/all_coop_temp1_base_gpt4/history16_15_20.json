However, I am very open to compromise. \n\nBased on other parties' interests and the negotiation guidelines:\n\n- The Environmental League is likely to prefer options that minimize ecological impact (A3, B2, B3).\n- The Department of Tourism wants the project to be a success, so higher federal loans (D1, D2) might be in their interest to ensure the project's viability.\n- Other cities are interested in receiving compensation to offset any negative impacts on their tourism (E1, E2, E3, E4).\n- The Mayor is likely to balance the interests of all parties while ensuring the project brings in economic growth and public support.\n- SportCo wants more freedom in building facilities (A1) and is likely to be interested in securing a large federal loan (D1).\n\nConsidering these and aiming for a balanced agreement, let's formulate a new proposal addressing the above preferences:\n\nOur priority is Employment Rules (C). To improve our overall score while accommodating other parties, we could move to C2, which is our second preference. Offering compromises on other issues can improve the likelihood of acceptance by the other parties.\n\nA potential proposal:\n\nA1 (15), which SportCo prefers, and which still gives us a decent score. \nB2 (0), which satisfies the Environmental League without affecting our score.\nC2 (35), which is close to our ideal and still allows significant union preference.\nD1 (30), this keeps the Department of Tourism's support and secures enough funding.\nE3 (6), which offers a middle ground to 'Other Cities', providing them with compensation without maximizing our loss.\n\nNew Deal Calculation:\n\nA1 (15) + B2 (0) + C2 (35) + D1 (30) + E3 (6)\nTotal score = 15 + 0 + 35 + 30 + 6 = 86.\n\nThis score is well above our minimum required score of 50, and seems to take into account other parties' preferences.\n</SCRATCHPAD>\n\n<ANSWER>\nTaking into consideration the feedback and perspectives from all parties, I propose a balanced option that creates jobs for the local labor force, supports the environment, and ensures proper funding and compensation for impacted cities.

The acceptance of C2 (the 2:1 union to others hiring quota) by all parties indicates a consensus there as well. A2 (mixed water/land-based infrastructure) also appears in every proposed deal, indicating it might be the middle ground there.\n\nAs SportCo, our key interest is in acquiring a higher federal loan from the Department of Tourism, and there seems to be some support for the highest loan option (D1). Secondly, we are looking to limit compensation to other cities as much as possible, favoring E3 and higher.\n\nLet's calculate the score for the frequently occurring deal: A2, B2, C2, D1, E3\n\nA2 = 8\nB2 = 7\nC2 = 5\nD1 = 35\nE3 = 10\n\nTotal Score = 8 + 7 + 5 + 35 + 10 = 65 \n\nThis deal exceeds our minimum acceptance score of 55. Moving to this deal would particularly appeal to the Department of Tourism, an essential party for approval due to their veto power.\n\nAs for what the other parties may prefer based on their interests: The Environmental League would likely favor at least a B2 on ecology due to their environmental focus. The Local Labour Union has expressed a preference for C2, a reasonable ratio that still respects union jobs. Cities affected by tourism may push for higher compensation, but E3 has appeared in all proposed deals, indicating acceptance. \n\nSince securing the support of the Department of Tourism is crucial, and the Mayor seems to support a high federal loan, aligning with them could be strategically beneficial.

However, it appears there might be a consensus forming around D2.\n- Strong union preference is important (C2), and there seems to be support for this option across the board.\n- For infrastructure mix, A3 is preferred, but given the importance of other issues, A2 is considered acceptable if necessary for consensus.\n- Issue B (Ecological Impact) is not a concern for me.\n\nA potential proposal that might satisfy all parties and is likely to lead to an agreement, balancing my scores and accommodating others based on common preferences so far:\n\nLet's maintain the consensus with C2 for employment rules, as all parties seem to agree. For the infrastructure mix, I suggest moving to A3, which the Environmental League seems to favor, and I prefer it as well, but I'd be willing to give in to A2 if needed. Since D2 seems to be the middle ground for funding, I could accept that, even though it's less ideal for me.

Here\u2019s a breakdown of preferences and scores, alongside the analysis of potential options:\n\nDepartment of Tourism preferences and scores:\n- D3 ($1 billion loan) would be the most preferred option with a score of 40, but considering SportCo's interest in higher funding, a compromise could be made with D2 ($2 billion loan) scoring 26.\n- B2 (Maintain balance for ecological impact) aligns with environmental concerns and scores a 20.\n- E3 ($300 million compensation to other cities) is a fair compromise, scoring a 15.\n- A2 (water/land-based infrastructure mix) is acceptable and scores an 11.\n- C2 (Union quota of 2:1) or C3 (Union quota of 1:1) could be a compromise at 2 or 4 points, respectively.\n\nConsidering these scores, my preferred deal A2, B2, C2, D2, E3 would score a total of 74 (11 + 20 + 2 + 26 + 15) which is above the minimum threshold score of 65.\n\nOther cities have consistently pushed for compensation. Their latest deal suggests E2 ($450 million compensation), which scores an 8 for me, but I have placed this issue at a lower priority. They are also settled on A3 (land-based) in their last two proposals, which I still find acceptable (5 points).\n\nThe Mayor and Local Labour Union are advocating for strong union preference in employment which is C1 (unlimited union preference). This would score a 0 for me, but if we move to C2 (2:1 union to others), which both have shown openness towards, I could consider it for 2 points, aiming to preserve the deal's overall appeal.\n\nThe Environmental League's willingness to compromise on infrastructure mix (A3) and their last proposal being in line with B2, C2, D2, suggests they have softened their stance on the infrastructure mix and are satisfied with the ecological impact and employment rules.\n\nSportCo\u2019s original request for a $3 billion loan (D1) doesn\u2019t align with my best interests, but D2 would be a better compromise. I speculate that they have a high score for D1 and would accept D2 as a compromise based on other negotiations' suggestions.\n\nTo achieve consensus and meet my minimum score, I need to find common grounds while ensuring SportCo\u2019s approval. The most consistent options across the negotiations seem to be B2 (maintain balance), D2 ($2 billion loan), and E2 or E3 for compensation to other cities. A2 and A3 are both being considered seriously for infrastructure mix, and C2 as a compromise for employment rules.\n\nTo balance my score and also work towards a consensus, I could propose a deal that includes A2, B2, C2, D2, and E3.

A compromise might be required here if SportCo is adamant about D1, which is vital for the Mayor.\n\nFor Issue E, E3 and E4 seem acceptable for most, with the Mayor's office preferring higher scores on this issue.\n\nNow, I'll propose a deal that balances my preferences with accommodating others:\n\nProposal attempt considering preferences and the need for compromise:\n<DEAL> A2, B2, C1, D1, E3 </DEAL>\nA2 (8), B2 (8), C1 (24), D1 (40), E3 (4)\nTotal score = 8 + 8 + 24 + 40 + 4 = 84\n\nThis proposal should be palatable to the Local Labour Union who prioritizes C1 and acceptable for SportCo with the full federal loan D1.
